In modern world, sooner or later, as a web developer you will have to create a API and a frontend application in React.JS or any other JS framework out there. It\\'s just a must have these days for any professional web developer!\\nThis is where I can help you. Take this course to learn how to create robust APIs in PHP, using Symfony Framework 4 and API\\xa0Platform. You will not believe how easy and instant it could be! I\\'ll take you step by step during the whole process, from creating your own robust API to making a modern React.JS application using Redux, Redux-Form and all the other tools that you just need to know to get a job these days!\\nCheck out the course outline, free preview videos, and read some of the reviews that my other courses got:\\n\"Real world course, made by a developer for developers, and very well explained.

I\\'ve found that I like Piotr\\'s teaching style the best out of all the instructors I\\'ve taken. He has the right balance of coding and in depth explanation, which is exactly what I was hoping to get when I purchased this course. Piotr provides some excellent insight into the inner workings of Symfony and does an awesome job of showing how you would begin to build a larger application utilizing the proper Symfony components. Symfony is a huge framework and I don\\'t think I would\\'ve been able to dig into the documentation and take it apart as quickly on my own. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to get their hands dirty and jump right into the meat of how Symfony works.\"\\n\"Really good course, i learned a lot.
