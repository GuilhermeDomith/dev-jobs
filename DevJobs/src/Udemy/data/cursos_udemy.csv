This course provides a comprehensive overview of Design Patterns in Java from a practical perspective. This course in particular covers patterns with the use of:
The latest versions of the Java programming language
Use of modern programming approaches: dependency injection, reactive programming and more
Use of modern developer tools such as IntelliJ IDEA
Discussions of pattern variations and alternative approaches
This course provides an overview of all the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns as outlined in their seminal book, together with modern-day variations, adjustments, discussions of intrinsic use of patterns in the language.
What are Design Patterns?
Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems. They were popularized with the 1994 book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson and Richard Helm (who are commonly known as a Gang of Four, hence the GoF acronym).
The original book was written using C++ and Smalltalk as examples, but since then, design patterns have been adapted to every programming language imaginable: C#, Java, PHP and even programming languages that aren't strictly object-oriented, such as JavaScript.
The appeal of design patterns is immortal: we see them in libraries, some of them are intrinsic in programming languages, and you probably use them on a daily basis even if you don't realize they are there.
What Patterns Does This Course Cover?
This course covers all the GoF design patterns. In fact, here's the full list of what is covered:
SOLID Design Principles: Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle and Dependency Inversion Principle
Creational Design Patterns: Builder, Factories (Factory Method and Abstract Factory), Prototype and Singleton
Structrural Design Patterns: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Façade, Flyweight and Proxy
Behavioral Design Patterns: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Null Object, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method and Visitor
Who Is the Course For?
This course is for Java developers who want to see not just textbook examples of design patterns, but also the different variations and tricks that can be applied to implement design patterns in a modern way. For example, the use of recursive generics helps us build fluent interfaces even when inheritance is involved.
Presentation Style
This course is presented as a (very large) series of live demonstrations being done in IntelliJ IDEA and presented using the Kinetica rendering engine. Kinetica removes the visual clutter of the IDE, making you focus on code, which is rendered perfectly, whether you are watching the course on a big screen or a mobile phone. 
Most demos are single-file, so you can download the file attached to the lesson and run it in IntelliJ, Eclipse or another IDE of your choice. 
This course does not use UML class diagrams; all of demos are live coding. I use IntelliJ and various Maven packages where necessary."

Or when you barely dare to change the code, fearing you might break it. I think we all know that feeling...
This course will learn you when you are facing poor code, you will be offered some techniques to refactor it into better code. And in the end, you will have acquired the skill to do code reviews and detect code that in the long run will not be maintainable, readable or easily testable.
Hope you enjoy this course and that we make this world one with better programmers; Cheers!"

Why this Course?  Why is this the best Course To Learn Java?
Well, if you are here is probably because you've either looked online for Java tutorials, or maybe watched a lot of youtube videos and still can't really grasp core Java Programming Principles.  
You see, out there on the Internet, you can find a lot of information, but the problem is that everything is scattered around and very frustrating to actually learn the right way since all you get is fragments of information.  This is where this Complete Java MasterClass shines - it takes you from nothing to actually building amazing Java Applications, and MOST importantly, you'll learn the Ins and Outs of Java Programming Language.  With the knowledge you gain from this course you can build any Java Based Application - Web Applications, Android Mobile Apps, Desktop Applications and even program your DVD Player!
Here's a list of some of the things you'll learn:
 Everything pertaining to Java - Java keywords, Java lingo (operators, if statements, for loops, switch statements, while loops) and many other basic, fundamentals that will help you have a solid Java knowledge.
I will show you how to install all the tools you need in order to run Java programs such as IntelliJ ( which is the development tool used to code in Java ).  Also, will show you how to install the Java libraries onto your machine (Windows, Linux and Mac).  By the way, if you are using Eclipse, Jedit, Notepad, Netbeans or any other IDE, it's all good - you will still be learning a lot from this course.
I will show you how to think like a Pro Programmer when learning Java, and how to use the Java knowledge and transfer it to build Android Apps , Web Apps (using many other Java Frameworks like Spring Framework, Hibernate and more)
Java Object Oriented Programming so you can re-use code and write truly scalable and efficient code.
You'll Learn JavaFX library and build amazing User Interfaces that will make your potential employers want to hire you right away!
And so much more....
My goal in this course is to give you everything I know about Java so that you can be the best Java Programmer in the market! So that you become a Well-Rounded Java Programmer!  All I teach you is what I wished I had known when I first started learning to Program in Java.

Don't just take my word for it, see what my past students had to say about my courses and my teaching style:

Also, does creating sound design pattern for your apps seem a little difficult? Shouldn’t there be a better way for writing codes where a little code can perform a herculean task? There is! It’s object-oriented JavaScript.
JavaScript works well with OOP (object-oriented programming) because of three major techniques that simplify coding for developers – Inheritance, Polymorphism and Encapsulation.
 Object-oriented programming also allows developers to contain pieces of codes that can be encapsulated within an object, which can then be called numerous times in the application without having to write the code again. Another benefit of OOP JavaScript is prototype-based inheritance, compared to classes based, which allows an object to directly inherit from another object. 
You will learn how to maximize your code using OOP and JavaScript, as well as so much more in this comprehensive course. 
In our object-oriented JavaScript course, you will learn how to perfectly blend the practicality of object-oriented programming with the functionality of JavaScript to write codes that are clean, concise and perform exactly the way you want them to.
The course will begin with a quick refresher on JavaScript and its basic fundamentals, with an emphasis on important concepts such as closures and prototypes. It will then progress to understanding object-oriented programming principles and how they can be integrated with JavaScript. You will also learn OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, etc. and how they can be used to enhance your JavaScript codes.
The tutorial will also include how OOP and JavaScript will perform in browsers with reference to Document Object Model (DOM) and Browser Object Model (BOM). The course comes packed with many coding examples, which the learners are definitely encouraged to try on their own.

Years ago, you could produce a web site with HTML alone. Now, Javascript is a critical technology that makes not just interactive web sites-- but full web applications. Modern sites don't just display data but generally help users complete tasks such as making a reservation or buy an item.
Javascript is a critical part of these transactions. Handling everything from dynamic screen content to interacting with remote servers, every developer needs Javascript.
And, Javascript is not just a web language any more. Due to related technologies like Node and Phone Gap Javascript can now be used in web development (client and server side) and mobile development.
This is only part of the reason that Javascript is THE language to know.
FACT: Javascript is the most desired skill among those who hire new (junior) developers.
(This means that Javascript skills-- and certification-- may just be your key to a job).
If you're reading this we don't have to sell you upon becoming a developer. You already know it's one of the most lucrative (and fastest growing) career tracks out there-- no degree required.
What Will I Learn to Do with Javascript?

Its primary purpose on the Web is to add more functionality to pages. Good examples of JavaScript applications are online quizzes and surveys.

  
JavaScript is always used together with HTML and CSS. To able to learn JavaScript fast, it is required that you are familiar with HTML and CSS. Familiarity with programming and programming languages can make it easier for you to learn how to use JavaScript.

  
If you are aiming to be a web developer, JavaScript is one of the fundamental things you should know and master. This client-side programming/scripting language is unparalleled in terms of usage and popularity. If a web page is not static, that page is surely using JavaScript.

  
Another reason you should learn JavaScript is that it is a good introduction to computer programming. The syntax of JavaScript is almost similar to most programming languages since it closely resembles C — despite having Java on its name.

  
It has multiple libraries and frameworks you can take advantage of. Just being familiar with JavaScript will be good enough for you to use and embed awesome functions in your applets or pages. Why? Because you can take advantage of its multiple frameworks and libraries that will make your life easier. Aside from that, it executes fast.

  
It is just plain simple. The functions and keywords of JavaScript are easy to remember, few in numbers, and “readable.” You can learn basic but commonly used lines of codes within an hour — and apply them to your pages or site.

  
It is compatible with other markup, programming, and scripting languages. You can use it with HTML, XML, PHP, Perl, and a lot more. You can be confident that you can use it without any problems in any environment you’ll find yourself in.

Save your precious time by buying this course. You will learn how to program in JavaScript in a fast and easy way!
The total length of the JavaScript course is over 12 hours! You will learn theory and you will also gain lots of practice. During the course, I will explain to you how to write real-life applications, like galleries with thumbnails, image sliders, etc.
I will do everything so that you understand JavaScript. After this course, you will always understand the code you are writing. You will understand all concepts and create your own applications!
After my course, you can become a front-end developer. JavaScript is a very demanded language by employers.
The course is designed for people who don't have any knowledge about programming or want to truly understand JavaScript. It doesn't matter if you have never written any programs or you have no idea about programming... After my course, all this will change. You will bust the myth that programming is a difficult thing only for the few!
JavaScript will bring life to your website.
By life, I mean inter-active, animated elements like:  
tooltips
image sliders
forms with pre-validation
slided panels
galleries with thumbnails
menus
and many more
Learn JavaScript in order to improve the user experience on your website, which will result in more visitors and sales, because happy visitors = a better reputation for your website.
JavaScript gives your website additional functionalities that can be executed on the user's computer without re-connecting to the server. This allows you to do things that you cannot do with only HTML. Because of this, the user interface becomes more friendly and more inter-active
Javascript is a programming language used for creating dynamic action on your website. If you want to remove/change/add content to your website dynamically, you must know JavaScript.
After this course, you will know JavaScript perfectly. This is the most organised course about JavaScript from Beginner to Expert on the whole Internet. I will take you step by step from theory to practical examples, like image sliders and animation. 
Understanding JavaScript syntax well will allow you to also understand jQuery framework better. jQuery framework is a large library of useful JavaScript functions that allows you to write less code while at the same time accomplishing much more.
What's more, JavaScript is required to understand AJAX which allows you to load content on your website without reloading the whole website.
  	  As a front-end developer you have to know HTML, CSS and JavaScript perfectly.
In addition to this, I'm adding two BONUS sections about Debugging and Best practices for developing clean, easy to maintain and well-performing code in JavaScript.
JavaScript is necessary for becoming a front-end developer. Imagine a situation where you have a clock on your website. You would need to request a new value from the server every second in order to update this clock. With JavaScript, everything runs on the user's end without re-connecting to the server. Just imagine what a mess it would be if the clock needed to reset every second. Your webpage would have to constantly reload to update the content, destroying the user experience. With JavaScript you can update the content without reloading the webpage. What's more is that there are advanced libraries for JavaScript, like AJAX, that allow you to connect to the database and retrieve information without reloading the website. To sum up JavaScript 'runs' on the web-browser of the visitor of your website.
I give you 100% satisfaction. If you do not like my course, you can request a full refund up to 30 days. Remember that if you have any questions regarding topics covered in the course please feel free to ask. I'm always happy to help!

Javascript Arrays are very important data structures that play a great role in web application development or any other software development that involves the use of  Javascript. The Javascript programming language provides arrays that are flexible and easy to construct and use. 
Arrays in Javascript belong to the object data type. The global Array object provides the interface to add and remove elements to generate lists that may be used for different purposes. As a result, Arrays exhibit attributes (properties) and behaviors (methods) just like other objects.
In this course, we will start by looking at the available data types in Javascript and discuss why arrays belong to the object data type. We will also look at the Array constructor and its available methods and properties. Then we will dive deep into the Array prototype object that has several important built in methods. 
We will divide the Array prototype methods into three parts, 
- Mutator methods, 
- Accessor methods,  
- Iteration methods,
We will dive deeper into each using an example based approach. "

✔ What's this course all about?
Python 3 programming course aimed at anyone having little or no experience in coding and a great desire to start learning Python from scratch. This hands-on training takes you from ""Hello World!"" to advanced Python topics in just a few hours.
First, you will learn and practice every Python 3 key concept, which is explained in one or more video lectures, usually followed by a short quiz and several exercises. 
Each video is filled with relevant examples, created in a learn-by-doing fashion and the quizzes, coding exercises and assignments will help you consolidate the main ideas behind each Python 3 topic. 
After laying the foundation, you will start exploring some advanced Python 3 topics, thus quickly growing your skills from Zero to Beginner to Intermediate to Advanced to Superhero level.
Next, we will build a scientific calculator in Python 3, having a basic user menu and both simple and advanced math operations available: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, raising to a power, square root, logarithm, as well as trigonometric functions like sin, cos and tan.
Finally, you will gain some real-life skills that you can use at most programming and IT-related jobs: Excel Automation, Database Automation, Data Analysis Automation and Network Automation, among others, using Python 3.
You will also be able to download printable cheat sheets to have every Python 3 concept at hand whenever you need it, as well as a 200+ pages Python 3 e-book that can help you continue studying whenever you don't feel like watching videos or solving coding exercises. What more can you ask for?
As a final bonus, you will also get all the Python 2 content in my older course, so you will be able to interact with systems still running the legacy ""edition"" of Python, which have not yet migrated to the latest version. It never hurts to be fluent in both versions of this amazingly popular programming language, although Python 3 is the most relevant version today.

""I am really enjoying this course thus far. 10-12 minutes into the course  and I've already written my first line of Python code, which I think  it's pretty cool, since I've never programmed before. I'm planning to finish this course and apply for a junior programmer, part-time job. Thanks for this training!"" by Andrei Vasilescu

This Python Network Programming course is aimed at network professionals having little or no experience in network automation and a great desire to use Python and a lot of very smart Python modules to program their network devices and tasks. This hands-on Python Network Programming training walks you through lots of scenarios, networking vendors and useful tools to help you become the network engineer of 2017.

Well, let me tell you what's this course all about:
 Learning to use amazing Python libraries and tools to manage network devices easily and without writing too much code.
 Connecting remotely to network devices and read/extract/display/store command output, using interactive Python scripts, on: Cisco IOS, Cisco IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Juniper JunOS, Juniper (Netscreen) ScreenOS, Arista EOS, HP ProCurve OS and Avaya ERS OS.
Configuring (one or more) network devices remotely, using interactive Python scripts, either by specifying the commands at the prompt OR asking the script to read them from one or more text files, on: Cisco IOS, Cisco IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Juniper JunOS, Juniper (Netscreen) ScreenOS, Arista EOS, HP ProCurve OS and Avaya ERS OS.
Executing configuration commands on multiple network devices from multiple vendors simultaneously.
Working with a device inventory in XML/JSON/CSV format and network metadata, while easily counting your registered network devices, getting device information by IP address, searching and listing device information, checking IP reachability and SSH availability and much more, using a simple but efficient tool in the Python interpreter or Linux shell.
Managing network device credentials in a centralized, encrypted file.
Managing access lists and converting access lists from one format to another using a very efficient tool (Example: Converting a Cisco IOS ACL to a Juniper JunOS ACL with a single command).
Automatically executing commands upon device login, right from the Linux shell.
Getting device interface information fast, right from the Linux shell and saving the information to local storage.
Working with Python and SNMP and easily performing SNMP GET, SET, SET multiple OIDs, WALK, GET-NEXT, GET-BULK operations on Cisco, Juniper, Arista and HP network devices, using only a few lines of code.
Parsing locally stored Cisco, Juniper, Arista and HP configuration files and extracting various pieces of information, using a very straightforward Python module.
Managing device configuration changes using a script that regularly saves the configuration files from your network devices to the local system, compares them with previous file versions, builds a report with all the differences and either stores the report locally or emails the report to the network administrator’s email address(es).
Performing various small network tests and operations using the Python interpreter.

✔ Still not enough for you? 
Let me describe a few more features of this course:
More than 15 scripts for you to download and use right away, for free. The scripts are customized for each vendor in the course.

Hi! My name is Mihai. I've been a Network Engineer since 2008, having the privilege of working for 3 major corporations and configuring, maintaining and testing multi-vendor network environments. At the same time, I managed to obtain several well-known certifications, such as CCNA, CCDA, JNCIA and CCNP, which complemented the skills I was getting from my job and increased the number of job offers I was receiving to my LinkedIn inbox.

But the thing that simply jumpstarted my career was learning the Python programming language and implementing it in some of my daily tasks and processes. I've been a self-taught guy for most of my adult life and, since I lacked the time to read endless, boring programming books, I chose to learn by watching video tutorials and ""getting my hands dirty"" with code. Unfortunately, at that time I was unable to find a complete, coherent programming course for network engineers, so I had to put together various pieces of information scattered across Google and YouTube.

Almost two years later, after I had the chance to practice my new Python skills intensively, performing various tasks on network devices and automating hundreds of network tests, I decided to create this course for you - the network professional who knows that getting a certification just isn't enough anymore in today's job market. The ability to write scripts and automate certain tasks is one of the primary skills that the big employers are looking for.

This course simply enables you to save time and efforts whilst acquiring these in-demand skills and upgrading your career.

 ✔ What others have to say about this course?
""I have been programming since 1978 and wanted to learn python. I have had no java or OOP experience, and I tried several 'paper' tutorials but got little out of them. The first part of this course is a steady walk through the Python language at just the right speed. The instructor seems to touch all the basis in a logical and methodical way while providing examples and explanations. I can only conclude the instructor is a professional educator who spent considerable time structuring and organizing the course. The result is evident. THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO LEARN PYTHON!"" by Larry Laswell
""I've tried learning from the books & multiple videos - most were too basic to make a practical app. Some books were too thick and made me sleep. But still none of the materials had the perfect balance like this course where all the basics were covered, instructions were concise, and Mihai walks you through how to create 7 practical apps step by step. I've also tried reading some advanced python book which didn't make sense because it was too advanced. Let me tell you, this is hands down ""that course that takes you up to beyond the basics"" to bridge you to the advance topics. Right now I'm hitting the advanced topics and it finally makes sense..."" by Joon Park
""Usually I'm not doing courses review but this time I will make an exception. During time I took a lot of trainings but very few provided by Udemy proved as having the right approach in teaching the audience. I will mark this one as being one of my personal top three best trainings as content's quality, technical explanations, and additional learning materials perspective. Long story short this course is a very simple, straight forward way of learning Python for managing IT networks."" by Johnny Stanescu
""This is a great course for network engineers who would like to start automating their tasks. Geared towards beginners, this course teaches the fundamentals of programming and applying those concepts to networking. There is a lot of fluff about python on the internet, however the instructor managed to put together the necessary information to start automating the network. A working knowledge of TCP/IP is needed to get the most out of this course. Should you understand every lecture, you will be ready to start writing your own scripts according to your needs. In particular, I loved the use of scapy, an amazing tool which should be in the arsenal of anyone working with TCP/IP."" by Costin-Alin Neacsu
""I've seen the blueprint and some demo videos and I was convinced right away. Without a doubt, it's one of the best trainings a network engineer can have. It gives you actual valuable and marketable skills that you can use in your daily job. Mihai explains the topics really well, with practical examples making it a fun way to learn. Highly recommended."" by Vlad Vlaicu

You have probably wondered what is the most practical way of learning Python (which to be frank, gives you the key to ruling the technology industry)
Since technology is changing every day, I have to learn something new every time. The best way that you can learn how to program is ""to program"".
Yet, nobody teaches in this manner and I suffer from the same pain when learning something new every time. Most courses are not designed to help you learn by example (immersion is the most potent way of learning in humans). Rather they bathe you with inapplicable information that you have to learn over and over again anyways.
This course is designed to cover all the basic concepts of Python and the syntax necessary for learning the advanced topics in Python. Even though Python can open the door to working with Data Science and Data Analytics and basically everything else with the word ""SAP"" attached to it, it has some new functionality and nuances that you have to cover and learn.
My job is to make this class a great and fun learning experience so that I can help you progress through your path to learning advanced SAP (whether it be just programming logic...classes....backends (boring) or doing fun stuff like Data Processing).
In this course, I will walk you though Python Installation, and you will learn about data structures (we hear a lot about data, but how do we store it?),
However, only a few videos per section are focused on information. I develop the rest of the details of the data structures and syntax through exercises that I walk you through in the course. There are 2-3 lectures on solving tough exercises on each subject so that you can understand not only the syntax and how to the program Python, but also what the crux of programming is in terms of how we solve problems programmatically and harness the POWER of Python.
There is no risk for you as a student in this course. I have put together a course that is not only worth your money, but also worth your time.

Begin your Python journey here. Over the years I have tried to learn many programming languages. Most of the time I never got past the basics. But Python is different. Python is beautifully simple and yet incredibly powerful. It's also easy to read which I love.
If you have just decided to learn programming then you have made the right choice, so take a breath. Python is very easy to learn which means that you will be through the basics and on to writing programs in a very short time.
Python is a one-stop shop. There's a Python framework for pretty much anything, from web apps to data analysis. Python is often heralded as the easiest programming language to learn, with its simple and straightforward syntax. Python has risen in popularity due to Google's investment in it over the past decade (in fact, one recent study has shown Python to be the most commonly taught programming language in U.S. schools). Other applications built with Python include Pinterest and Instagram.
This course is a step by step guide through the Python 3 programming language. You will go from a complete Python beginner, installing Python to creating your own programs.
There are over 130 lectures in this course and over 7 hours of video each one detailing a specific aspect of the Python programming language.
This course will walk you through:
Variables
Strings
Numbers
Comments
Lists
User input
Conditional tests
Dictionaries
While loops
Functions
Classes
Files
Error handling
and Tests...Phew!

- move to a more senior software developer position
- get started with Machine Learning, Data Science, Django or other hot areas that Python specialises in
- or just learn Python to be able to create your own Python apps quickly.
…then you need a solid foundation in Python programming. And this course is designed to give you those core skills, fast.
This course is aimed at complete beginners who have never programmed before, as well as existing programmers who want to increase their career options by learning Python.
The fact is, Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world – Huge companies like Google use it in mission critical applications like Google Search.
And Python is the number one language choice for machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence. To get those high paying jobs you need an expert knowledge of Python, and that’s what you will get from this course.
By the end of the course you’ll be able to apply in confidence for Python programming jobs. And yes, this applies even if you have never programmed before. With the right skills which you will learn in this course, you can become employable and valuable in the eyes of future employers.
Here’s what a few students have told us about the course after going through it.
“I had very limited programming experience before I started this course, so I have really learned a lot from the first few sections. It has taken me from essentially zero programming skill to a level where I'm comfortable using Python to analyze data for my lab reports, and I'm not even halfway done the course yet. There are other courses out there which focus on data analysis, but those courses are usually targeted at people who already know how to program which is why I chose this course instead. “ – Christian DiMaria “I have been puttering through your Python course . In that time, though, and without finishing it yet I've been able to automate quite a bit at my work. I work in a school system and unifying data from our various student information systems can be incredibly frustrating, time consuming, and at times challenging. Using your course, I've learned enough to write applications that turn massive text files into dictionaries that get ""stitched"" together like a database and output to properly formatted CSV files and then uploaded via SFTP to various systems for secure processing. Our teachers, students, and the tech department have greatly benefitted from this automation. I just wanted to drop you a note thanking you for helping me learn this skill.” – Keith Medlin “This course was great. Within 3 weeks I was able to write my own database related applications.” – Theo Coenen And there are many more students who love the course – check out all the reviews for yourself.
Will this course give you core python skills?
Yes it will.  There are a range of exciting opportunities for Python developers. All of them require a solid understanding of Python, and that’s what you will learn in this course.
Will the course teach me data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence?
No, it won’t do that – All of these topics are branches of Python programming.  And all of them require a solid understanding of the Python language.
Nearly all courses on these topics assume that you understand Python, and without it you will quickly become lost and confused.
This course will give you that core, solid understanding of the Python programming language.
By the end of the course you will be ready to apply for Python programming positions as well as move on to specific areas of Python, as listed above. 
Why should you take this course?
There are a lot of Python courses on Udemy – Your instructors, Tim and Jean-Paul are pretty unique in that between them they have around 70 years of professional programming experience.  That’s more than a lifetime of skills you get to learn Python from.
You can enrol in the course safe in the knowledge that they are not just teachers, but professional programmers with real commercial programming experience, having worked with big companies like IBM, Mitsubishi, Fujitsu and Saab in the past.
As such you will not only be learning Python, but you will be learning industry best practices for Python programming that real employers demand.  
And if that’s not enough take a read of some of the many reviews from happy students – there are around 100,000 students who have left around 19,000 reviews.
This is one of the most popular courses on Python programming on Udemy.
Here’s just some of what you’ll learn
(It’s okay if you don’t understand all this yet, you will in the course)
·       All the essential Python keywords, operators, statements, and expressions needed to fully understand exactly what you’re coding and why - making programming easy to grasp and less frustrating
·       You will learn the answers to questions like What is the Python For Loop, what is Python used for, how Python switch the traditional syntax of code, and more.
·       Complete chapters on object-oriented programming and many other aspects of Python, including tKInter (for building GUI Interfaces) and using databases with Python.
·       Although this is primarily a Python 3 course, a python developer will need to work with Python 2 projects from time to time – We’ll show the difference in both versions to make sure you understand how things work differently in each version.
·        How to develop powerful Python applications using one of the most powerful Integrated Development Environments on the market, IntelliJ IDEA! - Meaning you can code functional programs easier.  IntelliJ has both a FREE and PAID version, and you can use either in this course.  PyCharm will also work just fine.
(Don’t worry if you want to use another IDE. You’re free to use any IDE and still get the most out of this course). Does the course get updated?
It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New, more powerful hardware and software are being released every day, meaning it’s crucial to stay on top with the latest knowledge.  A lot of other courses on Udemy get released once, and never get updated.  Learning from an outdated course and/or an outdated version of Python can be counter productive and even worse it could teach you the wrong way to do things.
For example if you apply some parts of Python 2 to Python 3 code, you will get completely different results.
We cover differences like this in the course and also continually update the course as well.
What if you have questions?
As if this course wasn’t complete enough, we offer full support, answering any questions you have 7 days a week (whereas many instructors answer just once per week, or not at all). 
This means you’ll never find yourself stuck on one lesson for days on end. With our hand-holding guidance, you’ll progress smoothly through this course without any major roadblocks. 
That’s just one reason why Tim was voted top 10 in the  Udemy instructor awards (out of a whopping 18,000 instructors), and quickly became a top-rated, bestselling instructor on the Udemy site.  
Student Quote: “Tim and JP are excellent teachers and are constantly answering questions and surveying students on new topics they will like to learn. This isn't a Python course it’s THE Python course you need.” – Sean Burger
There’s no risk either!
This course comes with a full 30 day money-back guarantee. Meaning if you are not completely satisfied with the course or your progress, simply let Tim or J-P know and they will refund you 100%, every last penny no questions asked.
You either end up with Python skills, go on to develop great programs and potentially make an awesome career for yourself, or you try the course and simply get all your money back if you don’t like it… 
You literally can’t lose.

Elements of a site or application can be updated seamlessly without delay, without disrupting the rest of the display or requiring the user to refresh.
This course first covers all of the React.js basics like its API to create elements and components, the virtual DOM and the JSX syntax extension, using the state, working with browser events and components lifecycle methods. We then dive in and build an application from scratch to practically use the knowledge gained in the first part.
The application we will be building is an administration page for a list of books. You will see a list of books, then can add new books and remove books from the list. The final application will work with a server API to persist the data and it will use the Redux library to manage the data state for React.

As one of the most popular pairs of frameworks, learning React and Redux is a must. Simply put, learning React will open doors and jobs for you.
This project-based course will have you coding right away. By building four carefully thought-out example applications, you will sharpen your skills in modern web development.
First, learn the essentials of ReactJS by going through the main concepts. Then build your first React application to get familiar with the essentials. Second, create your first Redux application to learn how to pair this elegant and complex framework with React. Next, build an application that uses an API along with routing for multiple pages. Finally, build an additional app that works with another API and has more advanced redux mechanics.
You’ll not only learn React and Redux, but get comfortable with popular libraries like react-bootstrap, react-router-dom, and more. Plus, you’ll find a secret recipe to Redux that boils it down to three simple steps!
This updates my previous React course. One student had this to say about that one:
“I have purchased several React courses on Udemy and I think, thus far, this one gets to the point the quickest and has also helped me understand the concepts clearer. I am so glad I purchased this course. Some gaps were filled and I finally feel I have a good grasp on React. Thank you!”

This course explains every new concept thoroughly. So if you're new to web development, but have some coding experience you should be fine.
It's really most suited for those who have tried creating React applications in the past, and now want to master redux.
So what are you waiting for? Take the dive into React and Redux. Let’s get started coding!"

HapiJS, a rich and configuration-centric server framework for NodeJS allows  us to build powerful and configurable applications. Moreover, sentiment analysis allows automated reasoning about sentences to determine whether they are positive, negative or neutral. A popular use case is to find out how people feel about a product or service. This is course introduces you to a powerful Python package, NLTK (Natural Language ToolKit), that allows you to do more than sentiment analysis. Aside from learning and building together a HapiJS API and ReactJS App, we learn how to integrate the NLTK Python package (and for that matter any other Python package) into a NodeJS application.
We will start by first building a HapiJS server that can receive texts and send simple responses. We will interact with our server via Chrome's Postman plugin. Then, we will integrate VADER NLTK sentiment analysis into the server, that will allow the server to determine the sentiments of sentences in English. Afterwards, we will build a ReactJS client that allows us to enter and send sentences to the server and display the sentiment of a our sentence.

As of January 2019, this course has been completely updated with all new material!
The new content follows all the best practices of modern React development, and will take you even deeper into the React engine. There is a far better exploration of where React fits in the overall big picture of web development. And just like before, the course will teach how to create React applications as you build your own React projects along with the tutorial.

*****

Want to learn how to create React applications the right way?
With five minutes of your time, I’ll explain why this course is the best invesment of time you can make to learn how to code React apps.

*****
When I was first learning web development and software engineering, I used courses, tutorials, stackoverflow threads, and public github projects. It was invigorating - teaching myself the skills that would start a career.
But I often found that tutorials only showed me what methods to use. I had to piece together examples, trying to figure out why examples were working - why bugs were popping up. Even when I found a code fix, there was often that missing layer of how the update addressed the problem.
It was a grind, and the learning process could have been more efficient with better resources.
Fast forward five years, and I’m working as a full-stack software engineer at Zendesk in San Francisco. I often think back to those first couple years teaching myself web development.
The resources could have been better, more efficient, giving me not only what to write, but why the fix addresses the issue, and how the code works under the hood.
So that is what I’ve created in this course. A React learning experience that will give you all three of those important aspects to understanding code: what methods to use, why to use those methods, and how those methods work under the hood.

*****
I really believe that taking this course will be a valuable investment of your time.
I’m making the first couple sections free to preview. Even if you only end up doing this free content, you’ll walk away with a complete React application, and a lot of valuable lessons learned.

*****

Why take this course from me?
As mentioned before, I’m a full-stack software engineer working at Zendesk in San Francisco. I’ve also released 15 courses (a lot of them on React), with more than 170,000 students from 192 countries so far.
I’ve applied the best practices of software I’ve learned in my career, and the feedback from my thousands of reviews, to craft the best learning experience possible for you in this course. You’ll find a healthy balance of conceptual theory, and practical hands-on experience. You’ll gain skills right from the get-go in the first section. And you’ll build interesting and relevant projects throughout the course.

*****
In this course, you will:
Dive into React code right away. You will gain relevant experience as soon as the first section. Time is precious. And I want to make sure that you’ll never feel like you’re wasting it in this course. So in a matter of minutes, you will be writing React code in the first section, with a fully completed app by the end of it.
Understand how React fits in the big picture of web development. In the second section, you will take an important step back and examine how React fits in the big picture of web development. You’ll build a React project from scratch - discovering all the layers that are in between the supplies that supports the React app, and the browser which displays the React app.
Create relevant and compelling React apps. I’m betting you’ll find the apps both useful and interesting. Useful ones like the portfolio app will help you both learn React, and be valuable as a completed project for your software engineering and web developer profile. Fun ones like “Music Master”, will make coding lively, giving you apps you want to show off to your friends and family.

*****
In summary, you should take this course if you want to learn React in a time-efficient way, while building relevant and engaging projects.
Once again, the first couple sections are free to preview. And even if you only complete the free content, you’ll walk away with a full React app, and lots of valuable lessons learned.
See you there!"

A nice course, not only for those who's new to javascript world but also for a day-to-day frontend dev. - Duc Hong Quach
If you just want to learn React only there are a lot of other courses, but this one is perfect if you want to learn from the basics. Especially with the jQuery part, where that library is a very good example to learn how to manipulate the HTML DOMs. - Prabu Rangki

A very good, unique, to the point course. I have gone through many courses but finally my find is over with this one. - Anish Jangra

Ok great, but just learning a language is not enough and gets boring overtime. That is why, as soon as we finish with the core JavaScript fundamentals, we will begin building real applications. 
You will be building 4 Real World Applications using jQuery and React. Yeah, this course will teach you basics of jQuery, ES6 and React too. 
You will also learn to push your projects to GitHub pages for free hosting. This way you can build your own portfolio mand include at least those 4 projects you will build by the end of this course.
And the immense knowledge you will gain from this course will prepare you to build more apps for sure.

Hi and welcome to react JS course. 
React is a library by Facebook to create web applications that are fast, modular and everything can be done with just Javascript.
Now, before you get bore with this text, as you are a video learner, let me talk about projects of this course.
This course will first cover local installation and react basics. After that we will create 10 projects.
Ideal student for this course:
This course is perfect for someone who has little knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript. We are not saying that you need to be guru of javascript but little concepts like Loops and functions should be familiar to you. If you know ES6 that’s great, if not, don’t worry, ES6 is also covered in this course.
React is having very high demand in market. One of the top most searched subject on stack overflow. Most of high performance apps are created using react. If you want to stand apart from react, for sure you need to get familiar with react.
Also, if you are looking to move in react-native app development, that path goes with react js. Once you are familiar with concepts like JSX, props and states; same concepts are applied in react native too. And moving into react-native would be just a piece of cake.
Still, thinking about taking this course or not, we highly recommend to check a few projects mentioned in course introduction and free preview.
See you inside the course !"

I really believe that taking this course will be a valuable investment of your time. I want to ensure that even reading this description is a good use of time. So I'm letting you know:
The first couple sections are free to preview.
I believe that if you only end up doing this free content, you’ll still walk away with a complete React application, and a lot of valuable lessons learned.

*****
Why take this course from me?
As mentioned before, I’m a full-stack software engineer working at Zendesk in San Francisco. I’ve also released 15 courses (a lot of them on React), with more than 170,000 students from 192 countries so far.
I’ve applied the best practices of software I’ve learned in my career, and the feedback from my thousands of reviews, to craft the best learning experience possible for you in this course.

And I want to make sure that you’ll never feel like you’re wasting it in this course. So in a matter of minutes, you will be writing React code in the first section, with a fully completed app by the end of it.
Understand how React fits in the big picture of web development. In the second section, you will take an important step back and examine how React fits in the big picture of web development. You’ll build a React project from scratch - discovering all the layers that are in between the supplies that supports the React app, and the browser which displays the React app.
Create relevant and compelling React apps. I’m betting you’ll find the apps both useful and interesting. Useful ones like the portfolio app will help you both learn React, and be valuable as a completed project for your software engineering and web developer profile. Fun ones like “Music Master”, will make coding lively, giving you apps you want to show off to your friends and family.
Learn Redux the right way, breaking it down. Redux is a must with React. But it has a much higher learning curve, since the concepts are more complex. In this course, every Redux method is going to be taken one step at a time. You’ll dig deeper into how the methods work under the hood. You’ll learn more than what methods to use. You’ll learn how those methods work individually and together. And you’ll learn why methods are written in a certain way, and when they should be applied. That way, you have the deep understanding that will empower you to write React and Redux apps long into the future.
Build more awesome apps! As you learn redux in the later sections, the projects will remain interesting and relevant. You’ll make a mini React game, using an external API. And you’ll create a React app that has multi-user functionality! Supporting multiple users is a staple of so many web applications - but can be surprisingly hard to pull off. But you’ll find the solution in this course both elegant and extendable.
Explore backend web development. I think it’s important to learn essential backend skills as a React and web application developer. With React app, you’re often using APIs to supply the content of your application. So having the ability to create your own backends, and APIs, will give you the capability to make React apps of any kind, for your own unique use cases, long after you complete this course.
Deploy your React applications. The projects you create in this course will be deployed to production. That way, you can share your the products of your work with anyone you like!

*****
In summary, you should take this course if you want to learn React and Redux in a time-efficient way, while building relevant and engaging projects.
Once again, the first couple sections are free to preview. Even if you only complete the free content, you’ll walk away with a full React app, and lots of valuable lessons learned.
See you there!

Are you curious about Golang, Googles new Programming Language? Do you wonder what it's like to write fast highly concurrent servers? Interested in creating realtime apps, the simple way?  
If you answered YES, then this course is for you!
Learn Fast
This course is optimally paced so you'll learn fast.  Your time is valuable and I don't want to waste it, try out the free previews and I think you'll understand what I mean by fast/lean learning.
React Js
Reactjs is an Amazing Javascript front-end library created and maintained by Facebook.  The designers of React questioned the industry ""best practices"" and designed a library that is quite unique, extremely fast and very productive, plus it's a delight to work with.  Reactjs makes writing JavaScript apps fun again because of it's simplicity and fundamentally different concepts.
Golang
Golang is a awesome new programming language created and maintained by Google.  Golang is an modern language, that's simple to learn and easy to use.  Golang is particularly well suited for highly concurrent applications, such as realtime apps, because of it's first class language support for coroutines (called goroutines).  Apps created in Golang are fast, and run on all major platforms (Mac / Windows / Linux).
RethinkDB
RethinkDB is the only database I'm aware of that is focused on realtime features.  Using RethinkDB allows you to create highly scalable, realtime apps with ease.  RethinkDB offers a rich set of features and it's a joy to work with.

""But I'm only interested in React or Golang or RethinkDB...""
Each of these topics could stand alone as it's own course.  Just consider it bonus content! 
Are realtime apps important?
Software developers will need to know how to create Realtime Web apps in the very near future. It's the next evolution in Web Applications, in fact Realtime Apps/Features are already being created at companies like Twitter, Facebook and Google.
Get ahead of the curve and learn how to make realtime apps now.
Why take this course?
Do you ever feel overwhelmed with new technologies? I think most of us do, there is so much change constantly happening and the pace of change seems to be increasing.
What can you do to manage the learning challenges you're facing?
Lean learning
I won't waste your time, you'll learn just what you need to know as quickly as possible. You'll start this course with the end in mind. What do I mean by that? We're going to be building a realtime web application, and you'll learn just what you need to build the app.
What You'll Build
During this course, you'll be building a Slack Clone.  
Prerequisites
A general familiarity with Programming and the Web. You'll start from scratch and move quickly, learning just what you need to know and nothing else."

Check out the course outline, free preview videos, and read some of the reviews that my other courses got:
""Real world course, made by a developer for developers, and very well explained. Learner knows ALL what he does, and why! Congratz!!!""
""I've taken a few different Udemy courses now with various instructors. I've found that I like Piotr's teaching style the best out of all the instructors I've taken. He has the right balance of coding and in depth explanation, which is exactly what I was hoping to get when I purchased this course. Piotr provides some excellent insight into the inner workings of Symfony and does an awesome job of showing how you would begin to build a larger application utilizing the proper Symfony components. Symfony is a huge framework and I don't think I would've been able to dig into the documentation and take it apart as quickly on my own. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to get their hands dirty and jump right into the meat of how Symfony works.""
""Really good course, i learned a lot. Keep up the good job!!""

but it's quite another to build an app that still performs well when 
it's live with thousands of users. This course will help you take your 
apps to the next professional level, while making sure they remain 
performant at scale. There are many aspects to optimizing your React 
applications, some that you can apply later, and others that need to be 
designed in from the beginning. This course will give you tips and 
advice for both.
Covering JavaScript, CSS, and React-specific tips and advanced 
techniques, this course will make sure that you can build highly 
optimized, production-ready applications. The course begins by looking 
at important considerations you should build in to the planning stage of
 your apps: making sure options are set correctly, getting the most from
 Webpack, and optimizing your application's dependencies. We then go on 
to look in detail at some of the new performance enhancements that ES6 
brings, such as using let and const instead of vars and advanced memory 
management for strings. Next, we cover more general JavaScript 
performance optimizations, and using ExpressJS for fast server-side 
rendering. Finally, we examine how best to package up all of the 
individual parts of your application to achieve the smallest file sizes 
and smoothest caching.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  I never leave comments but thought I should share that this is best tutorial i've done on Udemy so far. Besides the great job of teaching react from the basics to advanced he goes really slow and explains every additional tool used, even things most should know. If you already know about the tools you might even learn something new like I did.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 
So I needed to learn React in order to build and pitch a prototype to the business I work for. We are trying to take our current offline application online and in talks we decided React would be a good choice for taking the next steps. Tim is very articulate and easy to understand and takes the time necessary to explain things in lamens terms. Would highly recommend this to anyone looking to learn React and/or Redux, especially if you're not an experienced Javascript developer. Glad that he takes the time to show how each thing works by itself and then ties them all together in the end into a full working app that can become your template for a new project. Thank you so much, Tim!
-- Brett Connolly
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  This course is a great place to start with ReactJS. Well laid out and easy to setup and start producing ReactJS sites. Instructor walks you through what is happening in the background and explains in terms that make it simple to understand.

-- Doug Brown
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  I really like how the course steps through everything and clearly shows how everything connects. The pacing was perfect for me and my favorite part was the transition to ES6.
-- Sarah Huynh
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  As a beginner, I found this course to be extremely easy to pick up and much less intimidating than I thought it would be. Tim is great at leading you along the way, while still giving out challenges that make you think.
-- Brent Busby
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  Amazing course that covers a large amount of material very well. I never knew all of the power that React had until now. I recommend this course for anyone who knows none/a little about React. Great foundation course and is still being updated. Great job!

You’re here because you are react BEGINNER and you have a mission : you want to learn React from scratch in a better way : step by step so you will master its main concepts and build Single Page Applications using React

I am here because i can help you accomplish your mission. I have B.s.c + M.s.c in mechanical engineering . I have been doing software applications for more than 20 years in the Hi - Tec industry and i have a lot of teaching experience. You can trust me and my teaching methods . I had learned many many technologies in the past (check my LinkedIn profile) and i know exactly what is needed to learn and how.

Check what students say about my course :
""This was one of the best courses I have ever taken. The pace and explanations were incredibly easy to follow. Everything important about React was covered and Nathan explained every little detail so well that anyone can understand it and gain a good understanding. I have learned a lot from this course, and I hope that Nathan will add others in the future.""

""I love it so far I will drop a review midway through :) from my experience coming from a developer bootcamp this way of learning is much more natural and effective! To be honest, I took two other react courses both of them lecture style, and I don't feel like I got enough from the time I put in, they were both about 30 hours long with sparse assignments I felt like a zombie just typing along. I feel like I'm learning a lot! Most importantly I feel like my retention level and understanding are finally getting somewhere and I can actually apply the things I learn.""  

""Nathan describes very very well, i got many javascript courses at Udemy, but Nathan explaines better them others.""


In this 4.5  hours course  i teach React in a better way then other courses :
- Every complicated concept is broken to few small EASY to grasp concepts
- Every lesson is FOCUSED on one subject only
- Lesson are SHORT, typically less than five minutes, so you can stay focused throughout it
- You have FEEDBACK after every lesson via the Quiz \ Exercise 
- You will feel PROGRESS after every lesson via your correct solution of Quiz \ Exercise 
- I do not believe in one project which last the whole course , because in my vast experience its much better to learn using small isolated samples . In this way you learn and master CONCEPTS which will allow you to do many projects , not just one that the lecturer did. Also small isolated code samples are better when you come back to the course to clarify specific concept (try to do this with one big project which last the whole course ...)
- Overall you will SAVE TIME in this course compare to other courses

The course cover the following concepts :
Component (stateless \ stateful)
Next generation JavaScript
React project setup
JSX
State
Props
Events
Debugging
Unidirectional data flow
Styling
Rendering list and using keys
Component Life Cycle 16.3
Routing using react-router

What's this course about?
Learn React or dive deeper into it. Learn the theory, solve assignments, practice in demo projects and build one big application which is improved throughout the course: The Burger Builder!
More details please!
JavaScript is the major driver of modern web applications since it's the only programming language which runs in the browser and hence allows you to provide highly reactive apps. You'll be able to achieve mobile-app like user experiences in the web.
But using JavaScript can be challenging - it quickly becomes overwhelming to create a nice web app with vanilla JavaScript and jQuery only.
React to the rescue! 
React is all about components - basically custom HTML elements - with which you can quickly build amazing and powerful web apps. Just build a component once, configure it to your needs, dynamically pass data into it (or listen to your own events!) and re-use it as often as needed.
Need to display a list of users in your app? It's as simple as creating a ""User"" component and outputting it as often as needed.
This course will start at the very basics and explain what exactly React is and how you may use it (and for which kind of apps). Thereafter, we'll go all the way from basic to advanced. We'll not just scratch the surface but dive deeply into React as well as popular libraries like react-router and Redux. 
By the end of the course, you can build amazing React (single page) applications!

My name is Maximilian Schwarzmüller, I'm a freelance web developer and worked with React in many projects. I'm also a 5-star rated instructor here on Udemy. I cover React's most popular alternatives - Vue and Angular - as well as many other topics. I know what I'm talking about and I know where the pain points can be found.
It's my goal to get you started with React as quick as possible and ensure your success. But I don't just focus on students getting started. I want everyone to benefit from my courses, that's why we'll dive deeply into React and why I made sure to also share knowledge that's helpful to advanced React developers. 
Is this course for you?
This course is for you if ...
...you're just getting started with frontend/ JavaScript development and only got the JS basics set (no prior React or other framework experience is required!)
...you're experienced with Angular or Vue but want to dive into React
...know the React basics but want to refresh them and/ or dive deeper
...already worked quite a bit with React but want to dive deeper and see it all come together in a bigger app
What should you bring to succeed in that course?
HTML + CSS + JavaScript knowledge is required. You don't need to be an expert but the basics need to be set
NO advanced JavaScript knowledge is required, though you'll be able to move even quicker through the course if you know next-gen JavaScript features like ES6 Arrow functions. A short refresher about the most important next-gen features is provided in the course though.
What's inside the course?

- ""Gatsby lets you build blazing fast sites with your data, whatever the source. Liberate your sites from legacy CMSs and fly into the future.""
Level-up your React skillset by learning Gatsby.js with a Wordpress backend! Gatsby JS uses React JS and GraphQL to generate and build static pages from a given dataset. This course will look at setting up Wordpress as a headless CMS while using GatsbyJS to generate a blazing-fast server-rendered React website from Wordpress data, such as posts, pages, menus, media, advanced custom fields, (and more!) using GraphQL to query that data.
That's right, we can actually query Wordpress data using GraphQL!
We'll be creating a portfolio website in this course, looking at initial setup and development of Gatsby JS and Wordpress locally, creating Wordpress template files and mapping them to React components, and querying Wordpress data with GraphQL to automatically generate our static pages. 
We'll look at how we can query Wordpress data with GraphQL using the GraphiQL browser tool. We'll get our hands into a little bit of Wordpress code as well, but not too much - the main focus here is Gatsby. Once we're familiar and comfortable developing with GatsbyJS and Wordpress, we'll progress onto setting up and deploying a live website using Netlify that re-builds our static web pages every time we update content in our Wordpress backend.
It's recommended you have rudimentary knowledge of React. We'll be covering everything else from Gatsby.js, Wordpress, GraphQL, and styled-components!
Speed past the competition!
Gatsby.js builds the fastest possible website. Instead of waiting to generate pages when requested, Gatsby pre-builds pages and lifts them into a global cloud of servers (we'll be using Netlify for this) - ready to be delivered instantly to your users wherever they are. 
No waiting for API responses
No waiting to render components based on requested data
No loading spinners!
No waiting for a server to compile a page to serve to the browser - these pages are already pre-compiled and ready to serve instantly to your users!
What other students are saying about this course:
★★★★★ 5/5 stars - ""Tom is a really nice guy with a good voice. His course is to the point and his response to the Q&A is awesome. I really like the fact that this course is not that long and shows you the endless possibilities that you can do with both Gatsby and the Wordpress API. For me this is a really good starting point in transforming a couple of websites without a CMS into a website with CMS"" - Edwin Boon

★★★★★ 5/5 stars - ""Tom's course is concise, clear, and gives you a good example of how to leverage your knowledge of React into fluency working with Gatsby."" - Rob Thorne

★★★★★ 5/5 stars - ""Straight to the point, no pep talkings, Tom delivers the course as a sharing-experience between two colleagues. From his experience, without pretensions of teaching but showing what he finds to be helpful, he drives the lectures smoothly intertwining react, graphQL and wordpress with gatsby in a minimalistic way that can be approachable by anybody. Don't expect complicated ract patterns as that's not the point; I really appreciate that from Tom, keeping the focus on the whole architecture, not react/wordpress/graphQL specific. Just be aware we are not talking about the old web patterns, so make sure you have a sound understanding of react, wordpress and REST APIs; and by his exposition, gatsby explanations will naturally fall in place almost unnoticeable; you will be using it already."" - Tony Guerrero

★★★★★ 5/5 stars - ""I had no idea this was possible! I usually use React but have never used WordPress before, but I found this was really well articulated. Brilliant course - thank you!"" - Carol Emma

The advantage of this course is the amazing virtual labs facilities that is available for free from Microsoft. The virtual labs comes with Microsoft Server 2012 and also Microsoft SQL Server 2016 and various instances of SQL Server like SQL Server Analysis Server (SSAS), SQL Server Reporting Service (SSRS),SQL Server Integration service  (SSIS). The virtual labs is ideal because it is free and gives you an environment that mirrors a real world production SQL Server environment. I strongly urge you to take advantage of this opportunity as I do not know how long Microsoft will have these virtual labs available for. All you require to access the virtual labs is a web browser . It does not matter if you are using a mac , Pc or Linux and there is absolutely nothing for you to install. The lab exercise you will perform in this course using the virtual labs are similar to a real world SQL Server production environment.
What you will learn in this course includes:

The course has four main sections. The first section is Base Knowledge. You will learn about SQL syntax, including specifics on the Select and Where clause. You will also learn about Case Logic and Summary Functions. The second section is about Joining tables. I show you how to use the inner join, join three tables, left/right join, and full join. The third section is Working with Tables. I show you how to create a table, Alter columns (add, modify, delete) and how to Insert Rows in different ways. The final section is on Practical/Useful applications of SQL. For example, you'll learn how to Compare tables, find duplicate observations/get rid of them, how to sort the way you want to, and how to update a table under certain conditions.
Each section has video lessons, followed by a Quiz (that tests general knowledge), and then an Assignment (that requires you to apply what you've learned.)

Oracle is currently the most popular relational database management system in the world. It is used by thousands of big companies who are usually willing to pay good salaries to the right people, which includes those with practical Oracle SQL knowledge that is based on best practices and experience.                     
Most SQL courses give you theoretical SQL knowledge. In this course you will learn by actually writing code.
In spite of what you might have heard, relational databases are not going away anytime soon, and the demand for good Oracle SQL developers will continue on the rise.
Learn Oracle SQL in a practical and smart way and jump-start your career:
Understand the most basic concepts about relational databases and Oracle.
Learn how to read, filter and sort information from database tables.
Learn how to use comparison, logical, set and other type of operators in Oracle SQL.
Learn how to use numeric, text, date, conversion, aggregate, analytic and other types of Oracle SQL functions.
Learn how to add, modify and delete information from Oracle databases using SQL.
Learn how to use SQL to create and use tables, constraints, sequences, indexes and views.
Get tips and knowledge that is usually only learned through years of SQL experience.
Much more.

 Oracle  implementation of SQL is very powerful. Learn it and use it smartly and stand out from the crowd.
I created this course because although there are many courses about Oracle SQL available on different platforms and in different formats, most of them, if not all, focus too much on “telling” or “demonstrating” how to do things, but don’t give you, as a student, the opportunity to test and practice what is being taught. Some of them tell you to practice or to do things along the instructor, but unfortunately, such approach doesn’t really work. Seeing how things are done or just copying or repeating what you see on the screen is not going to help you learn SQL. You might feel that you are learning, but when the time comes for you to write a command on your own, you are most likely not going to feel very confident.
In addition to that, most SQL courses, if not all, teach you the same kind of content you would find in a text book, but, what about those things that are not part of the “official” curriculum and are only learned through experience?
The goal of this course is to help you learn Oracle SQL in a way that can make you stand out from the crowd. I really want you to learn and shine, and at the same time contribute with my grain of sand to bring more talented people to the IT industry.
Content and Overview:
This course was designed with beginners in mind, but if you have some previous SQL knowledge you will still learn a lot.  After setting the learning environment, it starts with the most basic concepts about databases in general and a very short introduction to Oracle and the SQL language.
You will start learning about the simplest SQL statements and before you even notice it, you will be gradually progressing to more advanced concepts.
It does not include demonstration lectures because the whole course is a coding demonstration. In 90% of the video lectures you will be watching my computer screen while I type, explain and run Oracle SQL code.
It does not include labs at the end of each section because practically every lesson has a coding task for you to practice what you are learning.
Please note that PL/SQL (Oracle's procedural language) is not covered in this course. 
You are hiring me to teach you Oracle SQL, and that is what I am going to do, and I will do my best to help you learn in a way that can really make you stand out from the crowd of thousands of people who start learning SQL every day.
I will not only teach you SQL. I will share my years of Oracle experience with you through what I call “experience tips”. Those tips can really help you differentiate.
And you don’t even need to have a computer on which you can install Oracle software to take the course. I will show you how you can watch the whole course and do practically all the coding exercises from your browser, without needing to install anything, if that is what you need or want.
Oracle SQL is very powerful, and you are about to start learning it!
 You could be being seen as an experienced and knowledgeable SQL developer by your friends, peers and potential employers in a very short time, but you have to take action. If you want my help, you’ve got it."

3. If something needs fixing, please let me know. Again, I'm just one person and not a big team of people. I will try to fix it as quickly as possible. Thank you.
Video Information: 
1. These are straightforward coding videos
2. I explain things sometimes in excruciating detail
3. There are questions embedded throughout the videos
4. There is no talking head or fancy graphics
5. There are zips under lesson resources with the project files where needed
6. If you want to push your skills up, you have to type and run the code just as I do. Experience is the greatest and most effective teacher. 
7. As you create the code, stop and ask yourself this question: can you make one meaningful change to the code to produce a new effect or to show something slightly different? If you do this repeatedly, even if slowly at first, your programmer's ""brain"" will grow much faster. 
8. This course uses classic ASP.NET, and NOT MVC or anything like that where the templates are already very elaborate. My code is built from scratch, line by line. 
9. For the hearing-impaired, closed-captions are added automatically. I do not have control over those, so they might not be perfect.

These concepts are essential for building a strong foundation of knowledge for creating applications of any size or type.
Get the skills every developer needs to launch a successful career.
Get up to speed quickly with the C# language without wasting time by learning only what is necessary.
Learning to create software can be quite a daunting task. There are literally thousands of things you might need to know but this course only covers what you definitely need to know. The concepts in this course will be very beneficial to you even if you decide to switch languages later on because the concepts are the same across all programming languages and these concepts are the core of what all developers need to know before truly starting on their programming journey.
This course is somewhat different than others covering the same topic. As mentioned already, you will learn only the necessary parts of the language and more importantly, the concepts that are introduced are immediately implemented and then reinforced throughout the course to improve you knowledge and understanding.

This course gives an introduction to the most common loops: for, while, do while and foreach loops. Loops allow us to perform an action repeatedly without having to write a great amount of code. The concepts presented in this course carry over to languages like Java. Each lesson is an HD video with heavily commented code. I explain both the ""why"" and ""how"" of loops. You can also access a PDF version of the code under lesson resources. It's best if you have already worked with C# to the extent of having made simple C# console programs. The code presented deals only with console programs, not graphical windows.

Get an A+ in C# Programming

Everything You Need to Get up to Speed
C# is a great language, but it’s not perfect. With that in mind, this online course will start off by outlining what exactly C# is good at, and where its weaknesses lie. Following that we’ll take a look at the various platforms that utilize C#, which you’ll be using during the course to complete a wide variety of projects. 

  
After that there’s nothing left to do but dive straight in. Step by step, section by section, you’ll build your knowledge of C# with practical projects along the way to put your developing skills into practice. A section each is dedicated to setting up your environment; data types and their uses; variables, expressions and operators; statements and flow control; organisation; classes and structs; inheritance; interfaces, and so much more.

  
All you need to get started is a basic understanding of programming and a familiarity with the concept of object-oriented programming (don’t worry if you don’t have any actual experience). Suitable for beginners and intermediates alike, by the end of this course you’ll have a solid understanding of C#, its strengths and weaknesses, what projects you can use it for, and you’ll be more than ready to start using it in the real world.

  
What is C#?

C# is an object-oriented programming language from Microsoft’s C family of languages. It is a hybrid of C and C++ and was designed to improve productivity in web app development. It is used to build a variety of secure client, client-server and database applications, XML web services, distributed components and much more. It runs on the .NET framework and another very popular language was inspired by it; Java.   "

Regardless of what your goal is, wether its to find a job as a developer or not, knowing a little bit of coding can be really handy from time to time. 
And C# is a great language to start. Why? Well what I like the most about C# is its structure, its a strong typed language. What does that mean? It means that everything is ""defined"" in C#, which in turn lets you write beautiful code, you will see that at one point writing the code becomes an art, it just looks beautiful when you structure it the correct way.
Leave the aesthetics, with C# you can create anything, desktop application, websites, Android/iPhone applications, games, anything you can think of, you can create it with C#.
By learning to code with C# you will be able to jump quickly into any other language, if you need to at some point. The reason for that is, again, the strongly typed and well created hierarchy in C#, which will basicly teach you everything you need to know about coding in general. 
All programming languages are pretty much the same, on the basic level the difference is only in the syntax. All of them have variables, loops, arrays etc., so if you think that you will need to jump to another language at some point, do not worry, you will be able to do that with ease. I myself started with C#, then I moved on to a little bit of Java, then a little JavaScript, then a little TypeScript, and if I didn't have the solid foundations that I have with C#, it wouldn't have been that easy!
This is why I am able to help you forge the most solid foundations that you may ever get in coding. Just like everything in life, your first exposure to something new is the most crucial one. 
This course will teach you both the theory and the practice behind coding. You will learn by watching, by doing and mostly by struggling. 
You will also find numerous examples and projects to practice what we are learning and nothing will be left out. At the end of each section there will be a short quiz that will test you for some of the tricky parts of that section. 
Exercises are also provided so that you can try to code on your own, most of them will not be solved in the course, but you will get hints from time to time on how to solve some of the hard ones. And of course you can always ask a question in the QnA section of the course! I will answer within less than 24 hours!
Remember, there is no such thing as a stupid question, the devil is in the details!
Plus, you have a 30 days money back guarantee, so if the course does not meet your expectations, you can get your money back, no questions asked!

This course is best suited for beginner programmers or mobile developers planning to move on to Xamarin and cross platform development.  
Throughout the course, we will cover a wide range of topics such as interface design in Xamarin, dynamic outlet creation, game logic and user interactions. I have included all of the assets that we use in this series and also I make my own project available to you at the end of each lesson. 
This course is meant to act as an introductory Xamarin C# learning experience. By the end of the course, you should be able to develop a variety of interfaces and games logic and you should have gained an intermediate understanding of various methods for handling touch events. This should take you no longer tan 4 hours in total and I guess you should be able to finish it in one afternoon. 
I should mention that while this course is a beginner level, it does NOT cover matters such as basic programming concepts. It assumes you have some familiarity with the basics of a programming language. If you wish to start with this course and don't have any programming background, you should prepare yourself to spend a little longer to understand and follow through the lessons.
I wish you the best throughout your development and if you had any issues, please drop me a line.

C# is an excellent programming language. It’s the main language in the .Net family of languages, and as such, it allows you to program some truly amazing solutions. So, congratulations on choosing to learn this amazing language. :-)
As it is common among beginner programmers, the enthusiasm to learn often is not enough to make the leap from beginner to intermediate.  
The bad news is: code fear is real, and it hinders, or even stops your progress. The good news is: you can learn to eliminate it! And all it takes is a little practice and determination. And that’s where this course will help you greatly!
The course goes over variety of C# programming exercises and projects. I show you how to put the theory you learned into practice by showing you how to solve each exercise and walking you through all the Why’s and How’s. 
You and I will go on a journey to program simple solutions using basic programming techniques, all the way to more complex ones, such as multi-dimensional arrays, structure of arrays, and OOP solutions. 
In the process, you will learn a lot about C# language. You will learn how to translate the project requirements into a working code. You will learn to use many different programming concepts, such as Conditional Statements, Loops, Arrays, Multi-dimensional arrays, OOP… and pick the right one for your solution. But above all, you will learn to think like a programmer!
This course is all about practice. Therefore, to benefit from this course, you need to be an active student. It doesn't matter if you are self-taught or attend a programming course. What matters is the time and effort you are willing to put into learning and practicing your skills. 
There are no lectures in this course. However, I do my best to explain what I am trying to accomplish with each line of code, and touch on common pitfalls, too. 
This is a course for beginner C# .net programmers who need to put the concepts and theory they learned into practice and for people who prefer to learn by doing.
If that's you, then let's start coding!"

What's are the internals of a C# app. ,"Welcome to An Introduction to C# for the Rest of Us

C# sharp is one of the most widely used programming languages in existence today. 

In this course, we are going to cover three core concepts. 

  
The first is the language. C#  (pronounced “C-Sharp” and not “C-Pound”) is a hybrid between JAVA and C. 

  
It was designed to bridge the gap between the ease of Visual Basic and the more obtuse C language. 

  
Now, the language can’t do much without .Net. What’s .Net? In layman’s terms, .Net is a lot of prepackaged code we can use to develop our applications faster than ever before. 

  
We don’t have to create the code to use a button because it’s already done for us. All we have to do is add code to that button to get it to do what we want. 

  
So much of the tedious part of creating real world programs is done for us. 

  
The third component we will be cover is the IDE. An IDE is like a text editor built specifically for programming. The one we will be using is Visual Studio. 

  
Microsoft created the language so it makes sense to use their tool. Additionally, it’s by far the most advanced IDE on the market. 

  
In the course, we are going to cover the nuances and the fundamentals.  We are going to do this by crafting mico-programs. These are C# programs that do something very simple yet show us the functionality we need to learn how to craft our programs.

This course provides a comprehensive overview of Design Patterns in C# and .NET from a practical perspective. This course in particular covers patterns with the use of:
This course provides an overview of all the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns as outlined in their seminal book, together with modern-day variations, adjustments, discussions of intrinsic use of patterns in the language.
What are Design Patterns?
Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems. They were popularized with the 1994 book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson and Richard Helm (who are commonly known as a Gang of Four, hence the GoF acronym).
The original book was written using C++ and Smalltalk as examples, but since then, design patterns have been adapted to every programming language imaginable: C#, Java, PHP and even programming languages that aren't strictly object-oriented, such as JavaScript.
The appeal of design patterns is immortal: we see them in libraries, some of them are intrinsic in programming languages, and you probably use them on a daily basis even if you don't realize they are there.
What Patterns Does This Course Cover?
This course covers all the GoF design patterns. In fact, here's the full list of what is covered:
Who Is the Course For?
This course is for .NET/C# developers who want to see not just textbook examples of design patterns, but also the different variations and tricks that can be applied to implement design patterns in a modern way. For example, the introduction of the DLR allows us to use an ImpromptuObject, so that our DynamicObject exposes any interface we desire. This allows for dynamic programming, and many design patterns are presented in terms of their static and DLR-based variations.
Presentation Style
This course is presented as a (very large) series of live demonstrations being done in Microsoft Visual Studio. Most demos are single-file, so you can download the file attached to the lesson and run it in Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Rider or another IDE of your choice.
This course does not use UML class diagrams; all of demos are live coding. I use Visual Studio, various NuGet packages, R# unit test runner and even dotMemoryUnit.

Have you ever had an Idea for a program, an app or a game?
Maybe you want to work as a developer? Then you are at the right place. In this course you are going to discover how to become a c# developer - one of the best programming languages on earth!
C# is one of the few programming languages which allows you to create amazing cross platform Mobile Apps, Games and PC Programs. 
Bringing an Idea to life is one of the best feelings one can have, but the path to get there is often full of challenges. So I have created a course that makes this path as easy as possible all with the help of c# so that you become a skilled c# developer!

You start off by learning the C# basics and C# programming concepts in general:
variables
methods
arrays
if statements
loops
Then you learn the three pillars of Object oriented programming.
Classes and Objects
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Once you mastered them you will go into advanced C# Topics, such as Databases and LINQ.
In order to really become really good in c# programming, you have to program yourself, so I have created loads of exercises (and quizzes) for you to try for yourself to do c# programming and also to see how it is done afterwards. Of course you learn best programming practices along the way.

Equipped with those skills, you will build beautiful user interfaces with WPF - A framework, which makes creating GUI’s a piece of cake.By that point, you can create your very own complex programs.But what comes next is even cooler.
Learn Game Development with Unity and C# - Build 2 awesome games
As C# can be used for multiple different areas of programming, I have decided to cover the most important ones. So I have added a whole bunch of chapters specifically designed for a C# developer and Unity game developer - arguably the best Game Engine in the world. In those chapters you will discover how to create your very own video games by building pong, the mother of video games and zig zag, an amazing and successful endless runner game.
We live in a world, where knowledge and work are shared more than ever, so using assets provided by others is a huge boost to your progress.  You will learn how to use 3D assets to make an endless runner. Then you’ll use animations, reset the game, use particle systems and finally create a map procedurally. That’s quite some advanced stuff right there.

I know that learning to code can be hard at times, and sometimes you just get stuck. But no worries, we are there for you. We answer each question as quickly as we can and make sure that you reach your goal of becoming a developer.

WHO IS THIS COURSE FOR?
The course is for anyone, who wants to learn c# and wants to become professionally good in c# programming. No experience is required what so ever. It is designed that anyone who can handle a mouse and keyboard will succeed finishing it. The only real requisite is the desire to learn.

This means that if you know C# (C Sharp) well and can build desktop or web applications using it then you will always be in demand. 
.NET (and more specifically C# (C Sharp)) developers make anywhere from 80K - 100K+ (obviously the range would depend on where you reside), but the point is that C# (C Sharp) is not only a valuable skill but a profitable one as well. 
However, before going anywhere you first need to learn the fundamentals. Now, there are numerous courses, blogs and videos about the basics of C# (C Sharp) - so that begs a question: Why take THIS course?
That is a very good question and the answer is quality. 

  
What do I mean by that? Well, simply put this course is not just going to teach you the basics such as “what is an if statement” or “how to write a for loop” – that type of information is not worth paying money for in my opinion. 

  
If you want to learn the bare bone basics, then you can get that information for free. But that is not going to teach you how to put those basics and fundamentals together in order to build something that works.

  
That’s where my course comes in – I will be going over the same basics and fundamentals of C# (C Sharp) but I will be doing that in a context of an application which we will be building from scratch. 

  
Essentially the course is divided up into sections and each section is a console application that we will be developing from beginning to end. A console application is a computer program that is developed to be used via command line interface - meaning that we will not be focusing on the graphical aspects of our program but rather on the logic, readability and elegance of our code.
At the end, when we have built our application, we are going to go ahead and write unit tests in order to verify the functionality we have just created. Unit tests are heavily utilized in the industry and if you can talk about unit tests, write good unit tests and know what should be unit tested and what should be ignored then you will be way ahead of your competition when it comes to getting a new job or opportunity with a client who understands about technology. Obviously, all of these are going to be shown and taught to you throughout the course - remember we will be unit testing each and every application so you will see the patterns and that way learn how to do it yourself instead of memorizing and forgetting shortly after.
I think that writing applications in C# (C Sharp) is the best way to show you how things fit together, you will see the dos and don’ts of programming, you will understand and internalize concepts in a way in which you can use them freely in your own projects or products, instead of simply copying and pasting things without having a proper structural and foundational understanding.
Once you are finished with this course - keep checking back since I will always be adding new applications, quizzes, online coding exercises and much more. Just like my motto of never stop improving - this course is going to follow the same and constantly get better based on your and other people's feedback.
The best part about all of this is that the course is always going to stay updated and once new versions of Visual Studio or C# come up I will be making updates and examples to show you how the new features, syntax and tools are working. The most recent update has been made for C# 7 and Visual Studio Community 2017. However, once more updates come through the course will add those updates as well so you are not missing out on any of the newest features.
I look forward to having you as my student and sharing with you all that I have gathered along the years of practice, hard work and listening to my own mentors."

1- Using Xamarin Designer to add elements to your Android app
2- Using various C# constructs to add your game logic
3- How to dynamically add game outlets and manipulate them
4 - How to handle touch events
5 - How to sub-class existing interface elements

The course is a perfect start for beginner developers or Java developers who want to jumpstart with Xamarin. By the end of the course, you should have an intermediate understanding of various concepts in C# and be able to develop basic Android app games in Xamarin. 

Throughout your development, if you had any issues or concerns, you can always get in touch with me.

This course is about AWS Lambda function in C#. So now, for sure, you are wondering what Lambda Functions is and how you can use them. Let me please explain.

  
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the leading cloud provider in the world. It offers more services than any other competitors do and many of these services are connected and easy to use. As the rise of the serverless architecture, the Lambda Functions provide a good point to create a service that can be called and run when needed and execute a certain command. Instead of having to allocate servers for a certain events, Lambda can handle multiple request upon a certain limit instead of adding servers to it.

  
Lambda functions are easy to create via Visual Studio. Moreover, the people in AWS have a good support for it. You will find it easy to create a certain lambda project and uploading it to the cloud. Also, you only pay for what you use not for hosting. So if you use your function for 200 millisecond (That’s right pricing is per millisecond so cheap!) you will only pay for this amount of time no more.

  
 Lambda function can be exposed from inside AWS different services such as S3, DynamoDB. In addition, you can connect to it via any .NET application (Console, ASP.NET, etc.). Integration is easy and you will need only to provide your API keys and set the region. You are all set to go to connect to your function and do whatever operation needed for it.

  
Using C#, you will find it much easier to handle AWS Lambda Functions instead of trying to achieve the same result using other languages. And the NuGet packages for AWS SDK will expose many of the needed functionality for your Lambda Function.

  
This course will cover all the needed steps for you, starting from creating the project until unit testing. We will walk you through the needed steps to make sure that you can create a successful AWS Lambda Function in C#.

Think of a word processing program like Microsoft word - it has lots of advanced features that most people never use.   It's the same with computer programming.  A typical programming language has many parts that rarely get used, and a lot of what is taught in a typical computer course or textbook never gets used in the real world by professional developers.So why learn it all?  It makes much more sense to learn just want you need to learn to become productive, and be then able to apply for C# developer positions.   If you really want to learn these other parts of the language, then you can later, and its highly likely you will pick it up faster anyway at that point because of the skills you have already learned.That's what this course is all about - giving you the skills you need quickly without any fluff or useless information.
The course is aimed at complete beginners.  No previous experience is necessary or assumed. If you are coming from another programming language like Java or C++, then you will also feel right at home here, and you can skip any of the introductory parts if you wish.  But keep in mind there are subtle differences in C# compared to Java, so it's probably a good idea to watch all videos anyway.Here is a review from a student in this course.""Just like any other course thought by Tim Buchalka, the course is excellent!!!!"" - Jean UwumuremyiHere is what a student said about another of the instructors courses.""I am a newbie to programming but have an interest in learning and finding ways to perhaps apply data analysis in my current or perhaps future jobs. This course on Python gave me an awesome comprehensive base as a new programmer and I really enjoyed Tim's manner and the pace of the lectures!"" - Michael JareoWhat will you learn in the course?
You will learn about many important C# code concepts including.
Creating a C# basic program
All about the C# compiler
Answers to questions like What is a C# class, What is a C# property, how do you use a C# namespace and so on.
But importantly how to debug and refactor C# code, and how to get the best out of Microsoft's Visual Studio which is used in the course - We include tips and installation videos covering both Windows and Mac.  And Visual Studio Code is also discussed for linux users who do not have native version of Visual Studio available to them.
Check out the curriculum on this page for a list of what is covered in the course.
Along the way we will work with a lot of C# example code.  We'll start with badly written code, and go through it thoroughly to improve it and make it bug free.  This is an essential skill and you will learn that in this course.
The course uses a combination of small snippets of code, and then larger real world projects that you can run and edit and improve - you will learn how to think as a programmer and how to make the most out of the c# programming language.
What about course updates?
The course will get regular updates - We already have a document in the course that outlines what content is still to be added - We envisage it will be around sixteen hours once done. 
The instructors have built up a good history of updating their courses in the past on Udemy and this will continue in this course.
What about the instructors?
Your instructors Tim and Jean-Paul have a combined 70 years of professional software development experience between them.  They have worked for prestigious  companies such as IBM, Mitsubishi, Fujitsu and Saab. Their professional experience means you are learning from true experts with real commercial programming experience.
Their other courses on Udemy have attracted hundreds of thousands of students and tens of thousands of reviews - they have an enviable record of creating courses that teach people what they need to learn to become productive and successful programmers.  Many of their students have applied for and obtained programming jobs after going through their training.Here is another comment from a student in another of the instructors courses.
""I messaged once a few months ago when finishing you Java course on how it helped me also as a refresher on my c# skills.  Long story short, the owner of the Software Development company I work for now, after seeing my skills by accident, he asked me if I was looking for a job, I said not really but I would be interested in seeing what all was about, he asked for my resume,  set up an interview and he made me a quick test to see how far I was skill-wise and I finished the test with flying colors. He offered me a long term full time job right on the spot with a starting salary superior to what I was doing ($70,000 USD/yr to start and $75,000 USD/yr after six months if everything goes fine), really nice hours and benefits. So now I am coding with a real purpose and what I was doing for free in my free time, now is earning me a living, I've been working there for a month now and it has been great for them and for me. "" - Miguel Lara
What about if you have questions?
As if this course wasn’t complete enough, Tim and Jean-Paul offer full support, answering any questions you have 7 days a week (whereas many instructors answer just once per week, or not at all). 
This means you’ll never find yourself stuck on one lesson for days on end. With their hand-holding guidance, you’ll progress smoothly through this course without any major roadblocks. 
Student Quote: ""In the course there are several challenges, and when in need of a hint; questions asked are replied swift and elaborate. Feels like one-on-one support. It exceeds my expectations!” - Arjo TibbenThere’s no risk either!
This course comes with a full 30 day money-back guarantee. Meaning if you are not completely satisfied with the course or your progress, simply let the instructors know and they will refund you 100%, every last penny no questions asked.
You either end up with C# skills, go on to develop great programs and potentially make an awesome career for yourself, or you try the course and simply get all your money back if you don’t like it…

Take your enterprise software design and development to the next level with building Microservices using the new .NET CORE 3.x and Amazon Web Services.
Monolithic applications which include all the services of a software system in a big and complex application are becoming outdated fast. It is essential that software engineers master the concepts, patterns and details of implementing their future applications using Microservices. 
Working on projects that were based on Microservices, I could not find a resource which actually would teach me how to implement a system based on Microservices. Everybody talks about what Microservices are but nobody tells us how to build one! The few books that are out there have the same problem, plus they are too broad and so fail to hold the developers' hand and take them through the journey.
In this course we try to be more specific and avoid being too generic by focusing on .NET CORE 3.x and Amazon Web Services. Amazon Web Services has improved massively in the past year or so by introducing plenty of services that cater for Microservice-based applications, and so it is a great choice for our course. 
To master implementing Microservices we will build an ASP.NET CORE 3 project called ""Web Advertisements"". It will be based on Microservice patterns, and will use Amazon Web services for security, messaging, storage, service discovery and so forth. I will code the project in the course so you will see that how a Microservice is built, line by line!
You will need to have basic to elementary knowledge of C# and ASP.NET MVC. If you have ever used a couple of AWS services such as EC2 or S3 then you are all good for joining the course.

In fact, Spring is the most popular Java framework.
Did you know, a core reason for Spring's popularity with companies is it's IoC engine?
A typical company will deploy their Spring Framework application in at least 3 different environments. Having a development, test, and production environment is common.
The problem developers face is each environment is different. 
In this course you will learn how to use Spring's IoC container to deploy your application in many different environments. Through Inversion of Control, your Spring application can wire itself for the needs of each environment.
You'll start the course learning advanced configuration options of the Spring Framework. 
Next, the course takes a DevOps approach. You'll see how to deploy Spring Framework applications in different environments.
In development, it's common to use a H2 in memory database. Of course, this database is only temporary. Not something you'd want to use for your production deployment.
Do you want to see how to flip a switch and use MySQL? Flip another switch and your app can be using a RDS database managed Amazon. You can do this with no code changes.
The course also looks as best practices used in enterprise software development. 
Using a continuous integration server is a best practice. Jenkins is the most popular CI server. You will learn how to install Jenkins on a Linux server. A server you provisioned in the AWS cloud.
Once you have Jenkins running on your AWS server a best practice is to setup Jenkins on a friendly URL.
Jenkins is a Java application running on port 8080. You don't want to be typing some IP colon 8080 into your browser to reach Jenkins.
Want to know how you can use Apache and Route 53 to reach your Jenkins server your own URL? To a domain you own?
Docker is an exciting technology. You will see how to leverage Docker to host your own Artifactory Maven repository. We'll use Artifactory to manage build artifacts produced by Jenkins.
Just for fun, we will also use Docker to setup a MySQL database server. We'll do this by provisioning a Linux server on AWS, installing Docker on it, and then deploy MySQL in a Docker container.
We'll also provision an application server we can use to run our Spring Boot application. You will pull the Spring Boot jar right from Artifactory and tell it to connect to database server.
Amazon AWS also has managed MySQL databases. This is their RDS service. You will see how to provision your own RDS database. We'll then reconfigure our Spring Boot application to connect to the RDS database.
There is a lot of fun and challenging content in this course. You will learn:
This is a very hands on course. To get the most out of this course, you will need an account on AWS. You should be able to use the AWS free tier to complete the course assignments.
To get the most out of this course, you will  need a domain name. You will need to have control of the domain. Without this, you will not be able to configure subdomains in Route 53.
The course does leverage AWS for their cloud services. The skills you learn on the AWS platform will transfer to most corporate environments. AWS is used to mimic the typical company.
There is a lot of exciting content in this course! 
DevOps is not an easy area. Many different technologies are involved. 
In this course, you will see how easy it is to manage Spring Framework applications in complex corporate environments."

Some cloud providers are experiencing a growth rate of 50% year over year – which is just astounding. And the reason for this growth is obvious – cloud computing enables ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal effort.
Amazon Web Services is a cloud computing platform that offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, analytics, application, and deployment services that help organizations move faster, lower IT costs, and scale applications. 

  
Ever since its inception - the relational database management systems have gained tremendous popularity across the world. Recently NoSQL databases like MongoDB has also gained a lot of traction - but still, RDBMS remains the de-facto choice of engineers when it comes to storing structured data. According to some estimates - relational databases are used in more than 90% of the software projects out there.

  
With the advent of cloud computing - solution designers and architects had to deal with some unique challenges while attempting to migrate their relational databases to the cloud. You see, relational databases need high-performance hardware and disks to perform at the peak level. But IaaS cloud computing services provide us with virtual servers - which store their data on network connected disks. So to manage relational data in the cloud - we needed a specialized PaaS (platform as a service) which provided adequate hardware and redundancy to relational databases.

  
Amazon Relational Database Service (or Amazon RDS) is a distributed relational database service by Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS RDS is a web service running ""in the cloud"" designed to simplify the setup, operation, and scaling of a relational database for use in applications. Complex administration processes like patching the database software, backing up databases and enabling point-in-time recovery are managed automatically. Scaling storage and compute resources can be performed by a single API call.

  
Introduction of AWS RDS along with its unique features has made it very simple for us to deploy and grow relational databases to a very large scale in the cloud. What's more - the tight integration that exists between most of the AWS services - makes it seamless to deploy multi-tier complex and scalable applications. 

  
This course will give you in-depth knowledge about AWS RDS and demonstrate some key features and guidelines you need to know to get started with it. We will kick things off with an overview of AWS RDS. After covering the basics of AWS RDS - we will dive deep and learn how to setup highly available, scalable and robust relational database clusters which span multiple AWS availability zones.

  
These are some of the fundamental problems Cloud engineers, architects and database administrators struggle with on a daily basis.

  
This course teaches you how to design, deploy, configure and manage your AWS RDS relational databases with AWS RDS. 

  
If you’re serious about building scalable, flexible and robust AWS RDS databases for use in your cloud-based applications, then this course is for you. 

  
These database and Cloud Computing skills are in high demand, but there’s no easy way to acquire this knowledge. Rather than rely on hit and trial method, this course will provide you with all the information you need to get started with your AWS RDS cloud database projects. 

  
Startups and technology companies pay big bucks for experience and skills in these technologies. They demand database and cloud engineers to design, deploy their cloud-based databases  -  and in turn, you can demand top dollar for your abilities. 

  
Do you want the skills and be highly sought after? Do you want your career to touch cloud 9?

This course is about AWS Lambda function in C#. So now, for sure, you are wondering what Lambda Functions is and how you can use them. Let me please explain.

  
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the leading cloud provider in the world. It offers more services than any other competitors do and many of these services are connected and easy to use. As the rise of the serverless architecture, the Lambda Functions provide a good point to create a service that can be called and run when needed and execute a certain command. Instead of having to allocate servers for a certain events, Lambda can handle multiple request upon a certain limit instead of adding servers to it.

  
Lambda functions are easy to create via Visual Studio. Moreover, the people in AWS have a good support for it. You will find it easy to create a certain lambda project and uploading it to the cloud. Also, you only pay for what you use not for hosting. So if you use your function for 200 millisecond (That’s right pricing is per millisecond so cheap!) you will only pay for this amount of time no more.

  
 Lambda function can be exposed from inside AWS different services such as S3, DynamoDB. In addition, you can connect to it via any .NET application (Console, ASP.NET, etc.). Integration is easy and you will need only to provide your API keys and set the region. You are all set to go to connect to your function and do whatever operation needed for it.

  
Using C#, you will find it much easier to handle AWS Lambda Functions instead of trying to achieve the same result using other languages. And the NuGet packages for AWS SDK will expose many of the needed functionality for your Lambda Function.

  
This course will cover all the needed steps for you, starting from creating the project until unit testing. We will walk you through the needed steps to make sure that you can create a successful AWS Lambda Function in C#.

This course demonstrates a key strength of cloud computing in general and of Amazon Web Services platform in particular, the ability to go serverless.
By deploying serverless applications you don't have to maintain any server to operate your application and you can ensure high availability and scalability of your application in the most cost effective way, this is mainly because you pay only for the resources you actually use and only when you use them.
In this course we will have a conceptual discussion of N-Tier Architecture and the possible ways to create it on Amazon Web Services, we will also discuss some of the possible ways and services that help you create N-Tier Serverless Architecture on AWS. In this course we will create an end-to-end serverless web application utilizing DynamoDB for backend, Lambda for Data Access Layer, API Gateway for integration layer and S3 for presentation layer.
The demo in this course sets the foundation seeds for high complexity serverless architectures."

Do you want to implement your complete infrastructure as code? Do you want to learn the coolest and most popular infrastructure configuration management tool on the market, Terraform and make a huge contribution to your skillset? 
Then this course is what you need! You will not only learn how to implement Terraform code but also implement an AWS Well-Architected Framework recommended deployment model which will be Highly-Available, Scalable, Fault-Tolerant and Resilient! 
In this course, we will start by exploring the tools we need throughout the course. Just to note here too, we will need an IDE with a proper Terraform plugin available. An AWS account is also necessary so I will show you how to get one if you do not already have it. Sure we will set up our environment variables for Terraform deployments and also configure our IDE to use Terraform efficiently by installing a Terraform Plugin which will highlight the syntax and auto-complete everything we intend to do.
In between all these, I will also give you a crash course on Terraform where you will gain all the information you need to implement this infrastructure!
Once we have everything set up, now is time to get our hands dirty and write some Terraform code to implement our cool, shiny architecture!
We will start off with implementing our remote state and obtaining a key pair which we will use to connect to the instances we will launch. Once we get these done, we will first create the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment. To meet the demands of high-availability, we will spread our private and public subnets to three different availability zones inside a region. We will also create our Private and Public Route Tables to manage the routing between our resources inside VPC.
We’ll also make sure to attach an Internet Gateway (IGW) to our VPC to use with public subnets so the resources in those will be able to access and receive public internet traffic. Our private subnet also need some form of internet connection but not both ways; we want only internet access for outgoing connections from our resources in private subnets! To satisfy this requirement, we will launch and attach a NAT Gateway to our private route table.
After configuring the low-level networking infrastructure, we will proceed to implement our Launch Configurations for both public and private EC2 instances we will launch through Auto-Scaling Groups. Once we implement the instance launching configurations, we will move on to implement our Auto-Scaling Groups using these launch configurations. We will configure the subnets, machine images, startup scripts and simply everything we need to launch instances successfully. 
Auto-Scaling doesn’t come out of the box; we will need to configure it regarding our demands and how we want to scale our instances. For our implementation, we will use Target Tracking Scaling which will help use scale and manage our EC2 instances all by itself; we don’t have to do a single thing! 
We do not do anything for Auto-Scaling once we set it up but for sure we want to know what’s going on with our instances. That’s why we will create a SNS Topic and subscribe to it to get real-time notifications on what’s happening with our instances and infrastructure. 
There are much more to come in this course and I cannot wait for you to come and learn the best practices from an AWS Certified Solutions Architect!"

WHAT IS AWS SERVERLESS ARCHITECTURE / TECHNOLOGIES?
Amazon
has grown
	to become the most sophisticated provider of storage, virtual servers and many other various IT services, with
	the main goal of letting you concentrate on programming and
	system development, rather than the maintenance of the systems. 
With Amazon serverless technologies, you can set up a powerful computer
	system, consisting of databases, programming environments, hosting
	platforms, using only your laptop and an Amazon AWS account.

TOP 3 BENEFITS OF LEARNING TO WORK WITH AWS SERVERLESS ARCHITECTURE 
1. High in demand Experts in AWS are high in demand, with a huge number of either freelancing or full-time jobs available and growing. 
2. Emerging technology All of AWS services are rather new, compared to traditional skills like C++ programming or TCP/IP network administration.Being new, they are powerful and flexible on one side, but on other side, they can be difficult to understand at first. This course will lead you through various new technologies, some of which you may not know even existed. 
3. Great addition to your current skills If you are a programmer, you would benefit from being able to manage your own databases and application hosting; if you are a system engineer, you will be able to setup a complete system without having to setup a single server; if you are a system integrator, you will love the way different AWS services come together.


FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

Cloud-based infrastructure was a game changer for software development and serverless architectures is the next step in that evolution. Building serverless applications means that your developers can focus on their core product instead of worrying about managing and operating servers or runtimes, either in the cloud or on-premises. Many companies have started adopting serverless architecture for their applications to save costs and improve scalability. This course demonstrates a key strength of serverless computing in AWS using Spring.
This course will introduce you to Serverless Architecture and lead you to build a simple image-resizing service using a Java-based AWS Lambda function. Then we’ll move onto how the Spring framework supports the cloud and in particular AWS. There are a number of different services made available through Spring annotations to make your life easier. 
Moving on, you’ll start to build your Spring-based, serverless application that will take a URL and convert it into a short URL that will be stored in DynamoDB and you’ll receive a short URL. You can then use that short URL in a browser and then be redirected to the real site. To demonstrate integration with AWS’ Simple Notification Service (SNS), the application will also send a notification to you whenever someone creates a new short URL. Lastly, you’ll learn about monitoring your application using AWS cloud watch.
By the end of the course, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge to build scalable and cost-efficient Spring applications with serverless architectures.

This course is from a software engineer who has managed to crack interviews in around 16 software companies.
Sometimes, life gives us no time to prepare, There are emergency times where in we have to buck up our guts and start  bringing the situations under our control rather then being in the control of the situation.  At the end of the day, All leave this earth empty handed. But given a situation, we should live up or fight up in such a way that the whole action sequence should make us proud and be giving us goosebumps when we think about it right after 10 years.
We observe in quite a lot of interviews that most of us find it quite confusing (at the moment) to answer basic questions like the format of the a.out file, not having a clear understanding of the distinction between protected and private data members of the class, finding it difficult to create static libraries and dynamic libraries, not knowing that is there is really a difference between static and dynamic libraries, confusion in the usage of different combinations of dynamic memory allocation and free calls like new, delete, malloc and free , unknown about the difference between up casting and object slicing, thinking that the concepts of function templates and template functions are similar. 
The basic problem is here even though most of us are good at concepts, We get confused while answering when we come across a tricky question. As we all know, these tricky questions are simpler ones which are twisted and turned while asking them in the interviews. This is just to confuse the candidate in order to check whether the candidate really has a strong hold on the concepts.
Here in this course, We have tried an approach where in we are trying to make our audience understand the concepts of c++ through tricky interview questions.
This course is designed for almost 7.5 hours and a preview of 30 mins. Please go through the c++ questions dealt and the preview of the course. If you are interested, Kindly enroll in the course.

In this course you will learn many techniques how to be an excellent programmer. Below, I will explain what this course will consist of;
First video is  about tutorial regarding how you all can download free version of C++ editor on Internet. After downloading and Installing it we can proceed with our main course.
Moreover, Our main section starts with the hello world program in C++. Basically it is a guide on how to print the hello world string into the screen. I also talk about what variables are. Furthermore I discuss about the fundamental data types of a C++ program: char, int, float, double. Then I explained the memory model of C++. I provided a concrete example on how variables are stored inside RAM. I also talk about addresses and make a brief introduction to pointers. In this tutorial I talk about functions. I discuss the first of the three basic ways to pass parameters to a function. Moreover, I demonstrate the use of functions.  I talked about functions and pointer parameters. This is the second way to pass a variable to a function. Mainly I explain how to change the real value of a variable through a function. Moreover, I discuss its usage and I also explain how this works on the RAM model (I provide an example). In this tutorial I talk about the third (and the last) way of passing a variable to a function. References are type alias and a syntactic sugar. I also discuss the use cases of pointers and references. I also talked about type conversions. I demonstrated the implicit cast and the explicit cast. Moreover, I provide two different ways to perform an explicit cast: the c-style cast and the C++ style cast. Finally, I provided advice of which one is better and included quiz at the end.
The course contains 16 videos – and is just over 1.5 hours long. Watch the videos at your own pace, and post questions along the way if you get stuck in any part.

C++ is a general purpose programming language invented by Bjarne Stroustrup 37 years ago. It is still one of the more popular programming languages, used for creating high performance applications across a wide variety of domains & platforms.
In 2011, C++11 was born. This revision added lot of new features to the language and it got a new name, Modern C++. This emphasizes writing C++ code using modern features of the language such as move semantics, automatic type inference, threading, lambda expressions, smart pointers and a lot more. C++11 was followed by C++14, that added even more features and enhanced existing onces. In 2017, we may see a new release called C++17, that will add a filesystem library (covered in the course), parallel versions of STL algorithms, new types such as std::optional and more.
This course teaches C++ as an object oriented language with modern features. It focuses on teaching C++ concepts, both old and new, with clear examples. It builds upon the basic language facilities that are then used to build more complex programs with classes, operator overloading, composition, inheritance, polymorphism & templates. It even digs deep into assembly to understand few concepts better. After every few topics, a quiz is presented that tests your understanding of the previous topics. Have fun learning Modern C++.
Note that this course is not for you if
NOTE:The course will be continuously updated with videos on the more topics."

It was developed and open-sourced by Facebook and is now maintained by a large community of companies and individuals from all over the world.
APIs have become ubiquitous components of software infrastructures. In short, an API defines how aclient can load data from a server.
At its core, GraphQL enables declarative data fetching where a client can specify exactly what data it needs from an API. Instead of multiple endpoints that return fixed data structures, a GraphQL server only exposes a single endpoint and responds with precisely the data a client asked for.
What is Prisma?
Prisma turns your database into a realtime GraphQL API
Prisma is a performant open-source GraphQL ORM-like layer doing the heavy lifting in your GraphQL server. It turns your database into a GraphQL API which can be consumed by your resolvers via GraphQL bindings.
Prisma's auto-generated GraphQL API provides powerful abstractions and modular building blocks to develop flexible and scalable GraphQL backends:
Type-safe API including filters, aggregations, pagination and transactions.
Data modeling & migrations with declarative GraphQL SDL.
Realtime API using GraphQL subscriptions.
Advanced API composition using GraphQL bindings and schema stitching.
Why Prisma?
Resolve complex queries with top performance
Prisma comes with an advanced query engine ensuring that even complex queries are resolved as fast as possible.
Generated CRUD API as foundation for your server
Prisma provides a powerful filtering, sorting, pagination (e.g. Relay connections) API. You just need to piggyback on it.
Easily add realtime features to your API
GraphQL subscriptions work out of-the-box with Prisma. No more complicated & brittle pub/sub logic for your databases.

What you will learn?
 This course will cover these following topics
Getting Started with GraphQL and Prisma
Queries in GraphQL
Mutations in GraphQL
CURD Operations with Prisma 
Integrating GraphQL Application with Prisma
Authentication with Prisma, GraphQL, NodeJs
Filtering, Pagination, and Sorting"

Query Caching with Redis? You will learn it.  The Node Event Loop? Included.  Scalable File Upload? Of course!
------------------------------
This is a must-take course if you work with Node.
Node Internals: Here's one of the most common interview questions you'll face when looking for a Node job: ""Can you explain Node's Event Loop?"" There are two types of engineers: those who can describe the Event Loop and those who cannot!  This course will ensure that you are incredibly well prepared to answer that most important question.  Besides being critical for interviews, knowledge of the Event Loop will give you a better understanding of how Node works internally.  Many engineers know not to 'block' the Event Loop, but they don't necessarily understand why.  You will be one of the engineers who can clearly articulate the performance profile of Node and its Event Loop.
Caching with Redis: We'll also supercharge the performance of database queries by implementing caching backed by Redis.  No previous experience of Redis is required!  Redis is an in-memory data store purpose built for solving caching needs.  By adding caching to your application, you can decrease the amount of time that any given request takes, improving the overall response time of your app.
File Upload: There are many resources online that offer suggestions on how to handle file upload, but few show a solution that can truly scale.  Hint: saving files directly on your server isn't a scalable solution!  Learn how to leverage AWS S3 to implement file upload that can scale to millions of users with a few dozen lines of simple code.  Plentiful discussions are included on security concerns with handling uploads, as well.
Continuous Integration Testing: This is a must have feature for any serious production app.  We'll first learn how to test huge swaths of our codebase with just a few lines of code by using Puppeteer and Jest.  After writing many effective tests, we'll enable continuous integration on Travis CI, a popular - and free - CI platform.  Testing can sometimes be boring, so we'll use this section to brush up on some advanced Javascript techniques, including one of the only legitimate uses of ES2015 Proxies that you'll ever see!

------------------------------
Here's what we'll learn:
I've built the course that I would have wanted to take when I was learning to Node. A course that explains the concepts and how they're implemented in the best order for you to learn and deeply understand them."

New content being added as course completion nears!
NodeJS is a rapidy growing web server technology, and Node developers are among the highest paid in the industry. Knowing NodeJS well will get you a job or improve your current one by enabling you to build high quality, robust web applications.
In this course you will gain a deep understanding of Node, learn how NodeJS works under the hood, and how that knowledge helps you avoid common pitfalls and drastically improve your ability to debug problems. 
In this course we'll look at how the C++ written V8 Javascript engine works and how NodeJS uses it to expand the abilities of Javascript. You'll learn how to structure your code for reuse and to be easier to understand, manage, and expand using modules and understand how modules really work.
You'll learn how asynchronous code works in Node and the Node event loop, as well as how to use the event emitter, streams, buffers, pipes, and work with files. We'll see how that leads to building a web server in Node. 
We'll dive into web sites, web apps and APIs with Express and learn how Express can save us time as Node developers.
You'll also gain an understanding of npm, connecting to databases, and the MEAN stack!
During it all you'll gain a deep understanding of the Javascript concepts and other computer science concepts that power Node.
NodeJS doesn't have to be hard to learn. The biggest mistake most coding tutorials make is expecting someone to learn simply by imitating others' code. Real world situations are never exactly like the tutorial.
I believe the best way to learn is to understand how a tool works and what it does for you, look at examples, and then try it yourself. That's how this course is built, with the goal to help you both learn and understand NodeJS.
Note: In this course you'll also get downloadable source code. You will often be provided with 'starter' code, giving you the base for you to start writing your code, and 'finished' code to compare your code to."

NodeJS is a platform that allows developers to write server side high performance and networked applications. And that too using good old Javascript. But wait ! Isn't Javascript meant to be used for forms and stuff on web pages ?  
  	                          Well that was 10 years ago. The world has gone from 'Oops! You've not filled up the form properly !' days to today's modern web apps and social media sites that rely heavily on Javascript. Google Apps, Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus and LinkedIn, being handful examples of this movement. And to think that this quantum leap would not have been possible without Javascript is not an overstatement. Today, when you socialize with your friends on Facebook, or use your Gmail inbox, you're running thousands of lines of code written in Javascript, in your browser.  
  	                          With Node JS, you can take this knowledge back on the server, where usually you would expect to see the likes of PHP, Ruby, ASP dot NET etc. But that's only a small portion of the reason why NodeJS is so cool. The fact that you can write full blown networked applications (think chat servers, collaborative tools, real-time data visualisation apps) with just a few lines of code is more than reason enough to not only look at NodeJS, but deep dive into it !  
  	                          But I know PHP ? Why should I learn NodeJS ? Well, for starters, learning something new never hurts. But most importantly, learning NodeJS is great because :  

             The Real Problem
So, NodeJS sounds pretty interesting so far, but what really hit me in the face when I was learning all about Node was the fact that, with any new platform, framework or technology, you need to take baby steps, all the way through, to making real world examples, if you have to get to the grips of it. And that leads us to why you're here.
  	                      In this course, we'll go from absolute scratch, all the way up to building and deploying full blown NodeJS app on the Cloud !  
             Project Oriented Learning   
  	                          With NodeJS, we will build two full blown apps. We will go all the from concept creation, UI/UX design to coding and deploying our app on the cloud.  
             A. ChatCAT - One of the fun things that you can do with NodeJS is build realtime apps that allow a high number of concurrent users to interact with each other. Examples of this kind include Chat Servers, Gaming Servers, Collaborative Tools etc. We will build a multi-room chat server that allows users to login via Facebook, Create Chatrooms of their choice and Chat in realtime. We will not only create this app, but also deploy it on Heroku and Digital Ocean !  
  	                      You will learn all about using Websockets, Structuring your App in an efficient manner, creating and using development & production configurations, Authentication using Facebook, Setting up an App on Facebook, Managing Sessions, Querying & Using a Hosted MongoDB Database, Using Heroku & Digital Ocean's Cloud Services and lots more...  
       B. PhotoGRID - The second complete app that we will build in this course is a Photo Gallery app which lets users upload images into a gallery with the ability to vote up the images that they like. This NodeJS app lets users upload files, which are then resized to thumbnails on the server and stored in an Amazon S3 Bucket for optimal delivery to the front end interface. The entire app runs on an Amazon EC2 Cloud Server which we will create from scratch and configure for use.  
  	                      You will learn about managing file uploads using NodeJS & AJAX, Resizing Images on the Server, Accessing & Storing files in an S3 Bucket, Querying & Using a Hosted MongoDB Database, Using Amazon's Elastic IP Service & Cloudfront distribution, ensuring your NodeJS app runs automatically even if the server is restarted and lots more...  
  	                          In the projects above, we leave no stone unturned in terms of execution. This is a complete hands-on course that is not just limited to NodeJS but to the ecosystem that needs attention when a NodeJS app is built and deployed. My intent is hand hold you all the way from writing your first app to deploying production level apps on the cloud.  
  	                      And I'm always available to personally help you out, should you get stuck.
       BONUS :: Here's the best thing about this course. The curriculum that you see gets you up and running with NodeJS & Cloud Deployment. However, there is so much more that you can do with NodeJS, which is why I will keep adding new lectures and sections to this course on an ongoing basis. There is so much more that you will get with full lifetime access to lectures and all updates !!  
  	                          So, join in the fun !  "

HapiJS, a rich and configuration-centric server framework for NodeJS allows  us to build powerful and configurable applications. Moreover, sentiment analysis allows automated reasoning about sentences to determine whether they are positive, negative or neutral. A popular use case is to find out how people feel about a product or service. This is course introduces you to a powerful Python package, NLTK (Natural Language ToolKit), that allows you to do more than sentiment analysis. Aside from learning and building together a HapiJS API and ReactJS App, we learn how to integrate the NLTK Python package (and for that matter any other Python package) into a NodeJS application.
We will start by first building a HapiJS server that can receive texts and send simple responses. We will interact with our server via Chrome's Postman plugin. Then, we will integrate VADER NLTK sentiment analysis into the server, that will allow the server to determine the sentiments of sentences in English. Afterwards, we will build a ReactJS client that allows us to enter and send sentences to the server and display the sentiment of a our sentence.
So, in summary, this learning by doing doing course is prepared for you to:"

Have you tried to learn Node before? You start a new course, and the instructor has you installing a bunch of libraries before you even know what Node is or how it works. You eventually get stuck and reach out to the instructor, but you get no reply. You then close the course and never open it again.
Sound familiar?
I created this course to be what I wanted when I was learning Node.
The Complete Node.js Developer Course covers the fundamentals of Node before diving deep into great tools like Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB.
The entire course is based around a single goal: Turning you into a professional Node developer capable of developing, testing, and deploying real-world production applications.
The best way to learn Node is by building Node apps.
From the very start you’ll be programming every project and working through challenges that I’ve designed to reinforce what you’ve learned. This will give you the hands-on experience necessary to be able to create and launch your own project once you’re done.
You’ll be building four projects:
1. A note-taking app to get your feet wet
2. A weather application that interacts with the MapBox and Dark Sky APIs
3. A task manager REST API complete with user accounts and authentication
4. A real-time chat app with a client-side companion
By the end, you’ll be able to take what you’ve learned and launch your own Node application.
When learning, learn the latest.
I work to keep this course full of the most up-to-date Node material out there. This course is compatible with the latest Node.js version.
You’re getting access to hot-off-the-press features.
Everything you need comes in one easy-to-use package.
You can stop worrying if you're learning the right skills to build an app or land a new job. I've curated all the tech that's essential to building real-world apps. I've mapped out everything in a comprehensive, easy-to-follow package designed to get you up and running in a few weeks.
There’s no better time to learn Node.
According to the 2016 Stack Overflow Survey, Node is in the top ten for back-end popularity and back-end salary, with an average salary of $85k. This means more jobs and more opportunities for you.
You might get stuck. But I’m here to help.
There’s nothing worse than getting five hours into a course, getting stuck, and not getting the help you need to continue.
I’m in the Q&A everyday to help you get unstuck. I reply to every question to get you back on track.
Don’t take my word for it. Check the reviews and see what other students are saying.

Sample of the reviews:       
★★★★★  
Chad Darby has done a superb job organizing this course, and has made Spring Framework, MVC, AOP, Hibernate, Security easy to learn and use. I have a bs and ms in CS, have been developing software for 25 years, and have taken many courses over the years at the different companies I've been at and Chad is easily the best instructor I've had. 
He's extremely well-organized and knowledgeable, and lays out this course in a step-by-step approach to fully cover the material and make it easy to learn. I highly recommend this course, and Chad as an instructor. 
I'm adding to my review following Chad's recent updates to his course to cover Spring Boot, JPA, etc. After finishing the course originally, I found another Spring Boot class, and after working on this other class, I appreciate more what Chad has done here. He's made Spring Boot for CRUD applications with Thymeleaf very easy to follow and learn. I've taken half a dozen other software courses, and while other instructors might be good, Chad is the gold standard here. I can't recommend him highly enough.  - Dave Zeltserman

This course is fully up to date and covers the latest versions of Spring 5 and Hibernate 5 (fresh update February 2019). The course also includes new content on Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Data REST and Thymeleaf. 
Beware of other Udemy Spring/Hibernate courses. Most of them are outdated and use old versions of Spring and Hibernate. Don’t waste your time or money on learning outdated technology. 
Also, I create all of the code from scratch in this course. Beware of other courses, those instructors simply copy/paste from their github repo or they use pre-written code. Their approach is not ideal for real-time learning. 
Take my course where I show you how to create all of the code from scratch. You can type the code along with me in the videos, which is the best way to learn.
I am a very responsive instructor and I am available to answer your questions and help you work through any problems. 
Finally, all source code is provided with the course along with setup instructions.

You will see how easy it is to use Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Spring Data JPA to create a functional web application running under Tomcat with a H2 in-memory database.
Use Test Driven Development!
In addition to teaching you Spring Framework 5, you will learn about modern best practices used in enterprise application development. 
As we build the applications, you'll see me using Test Driven Development (TDD) with JUnit and Mockito.
You will learn how to test Spring applications using JUnit 4 and JUnit 5. While JUnit 5 has been released for some time, many companies are still using JUnit 4.
See how using Mockito mocks will keep your Spring Framework unit tests light and fast!
You'll also see how the Spring context can be used for more complex integration tests.
These techniques are best practices used by companies all over the world to build and manage large scale Spring Framework applications.
GitHub Source Code
You will have complete access to all source code examples used in the course.
In each lesson where we write code, you will have a link to GitHub with two branches in the Github repository. 
The first branch is the starting state of the code. 
The second branch is the ending state of the code. 
You can see exactly what changed in each lesson. Each step of the way, you have a working example you can use for troubleshooting.
In fact, you will get access to 24 (and growing!) different GitHub repositories - each packed with Spring Framework programming examples. 
And, you're encouraged to fork my GitHub repositories so you can share the Spring Framework applications, which you built, to future employers! 
Continuous Integration Builds
Since we are using GitHub and have great test coverage, I also show you how easy it is to set up Continuous Integration builds with CircleCI. 
Continuous Integration builds are another best practice used by enterprise developers. 
Using CircleCI makes your CI builds a snap!
Project Lombok
We all know Java development can require a lot of boiler plate code. It's just the nature of Java.
Would you like to see how to slash your boiler plate code using Project Lombok?
Spring Data JPA and Hibernate
Spring MVC and Hibernate have long been cornerstones of the Spring Framework. You will learn how to use Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA and Hibernate to build a real world web application. You'll learn about Hibernate configuration, and about the mapping of JPA entities. 
The Thymeleaf template engine is hugely popular with the Spring community. You will see how easy Spring Boot makes using Thymeleaf with Spring MVC.
While Bootstrap CSS is not a focus of the course, we will leverage Bootstrap CSS to make our web pages look awesome!
Spring MVC
Spring MVC has a lot of robust capabilities.
I start you off showing you how to build recipe application (using TDD, of course). 
Initially, it's all happy path development. We go back and add custom exception handling, form validation, and internationalization.
In the course you will also learn how to use Spring MVC to create RESTful APIs.
Reactive Programming
A big theme of Spring Framework 5 is Reactive Programming. 
Inside the course we build a web application using Thymeleaf, Spring MVC, Spring Data MongoDB, and MongoDB.
We then take the MongoDB application we built and convert it to a Reactive application. You'll see how you can leverage the new Reactive types inside the Spring Framework from the data tier to the web tier.
You will get to see step by step how to convert a traditional Spring MVC application to an end to end reactive application using the WebFlux framework - which is brand new to Spring Framework 5.
Spring Pet Clinic
Spring Pet Clinic is a classic reference application used to demonstrate best practices. The Pet Clinic application actually has it's origin within the J2EE/JEE community. 
The Spring Framework team took the original Pet Clinic application and rebuilt it using Spring, to demonstrate best practices. 
In this course, we will re-create the Spring Pet Clinic application. 
You will get to see how to create a Spring Framework application from the ground up. Step by Step.
The approach used to develop the Spring Pet Clinic application is slightly different than the other applications developed in the course.
In addition to showing you how to build a Spring Framework application, you will see best practices in software development. 
We start off the Pet Clinic project by creating a GitHub repository. Then using Spring Initializer to generate the basic shell of Spring Boot project.
Next you see how to use GitHub to mimic Agile development practices, such as using issues and a backlog.
We plan development of the Spring Pet Clinic using GitHub Issues. Planning work into issues creates a work backlog, which is an important Agile concept.
In fact, many organizations have a formal rule that no code is changed without having an issue or some type of ticket (in Github, Jira, or some other issue tracker)
From there, we use GitHub issues to complete programming assignments. Lessons start with a GitHub ticket, then we complete the programming assignment. 
You will see how to build a Spring Framework application, step by step, using best practices in software development.

This is where Spring MVC and Spring Boot come to the rescue. They are lightweight frameworks that will help you develop flexible and robust stand-alone applications without much hassle. 
This Learning Path is designed to introduce you to advantages of having frameworks, such as Spring MVC and Spring Boot, while developing apps. 
A Video Learning Path from Packt essentially contains multiple video courses that are logically tied together to provide you with a larger learning curve. 
Let’s dig into what this Learning Path does. It gets you started with creating, deploying, and running a Spring MVC project using Spring Tool Suite and then moves onto building a Spring Boot application. It will also show you how to integrate model and business services based on an example of an online e-commerce chocolate store!  
Once you have gained hands-on experience with Spring MVC, the course will introduce Spring Boot. Then move on to learn Spring Boot by scaffolding an application and understanding different aspects of it. In addition to that, you will also learn to secure applications against malicious behavior. 
After completing the course, you will be able to successfully create stand-alone, Spring-based applications using Java that work on multiple platforms!
About the Authors:
For this Learning Path, Packt has brought the works of two authors who are working very closely with Java, Spring, and Spring Boot.  
Koushik Kothagal has over 12 years of professional experience working with various server-side technologies and developing web applications. He has worked extensively with Java, Spring, Oracle, and other enterprise technologies. He loves teaching, and when he’s not coding Java, he’s probably teaching it! In his spare time, he runs the tutorial website Java Brains which covers various enterprise Java technologies.
Greg L. Turnquist has developed software professionally since 1997. From 2002 to 2010, he was part of the senior software team that worked on Harris' $3.5 billion FAA telco program, architecting mission-critical enterprise apps while managing a software team. He provided after-hours support to a nation-wide telco system and is no stranger to midnight failures and software triages. In 2010, he joined the SpringSource division of VMware, which was spun off into Pivotal in 2013."

It’s built around a DispatcherServlet.
Spring Boot 2.0 is a way to create standalone Spring based Applications that you can just run – so it simplifies the entire process of creating and deploying Spring apps – It can embed databases and do all sorts of configuration automatically.These three areas are a great place to start – just having these skills will take you a long way.  Of course, there is more to learn, but these are the areas to focus on initially.Why this course is perfect if you want to learn Spring 5 fast.Firstly, here are some comments about the course.
""Great and deep understanding of Spring in this course. Perfect speed, new technologies, and explanation of every detail. "" - Arkadiusz Siry
""Amazing.Very good instructions"" - Emmanuel Akono SarsahCheck the reviews for more - This is one of the highest rated Spring courses on Udemy.A Java Spring tutorial needs to teach you the core technologies listed above as an absolute minimum.  This course will get you up to speed with those technologies.Having good knowledge of a Java template engine that works with the Spring 5 framework, and a detailed understanding of the build tools (for building single and multi module projects) is highly desirable.We’ve added comprehensive training for Thymeleaf 4 as well as Maven 3 in the course to give you those skills.This content is ready for you to get started with today.  We’ve been working hard on some final training that we believe will round out a Spring developers skills perfectly.The final content we are in the process of adding to the course now is for Gradle (another build tool), Spring Data (provides access to persistence stores), JPA (Java Persistence Layer), Hibernate (Object Relational Mapping tool) and database versioning (like source control but for databases).This content will be provided to existing students in the course for free in the coming weeks.
Bonus Free Spring trainingOur original course was released with Spring 4 which was the current version at the time – we created a course around that, using the Eclipse editor.Unlike other Udemy Spring courses, we completely upgraded the content to Spring 5 – We re-recorded what is effectively a brand new course for Spring 5 using JetBrains award winning IntelliJ IDEA and released if free to existing students.This older content is still available for you to access after you have been through the brand new training – It’s still useful as some companies still use Spring 4 technology.What skills do you need to take the course?This course is for anyone who wants to get into Spring framework programming.  We assume you have never used Spring previously.Any Java Enterprise edition (Java EE) technology requires you to know at least some Java programming. That’s because Java EE is built on top of the Java Standard Edition (Java SE).  That’s the regular Java language.The Spring Framework is built on top of Java EE, and thus you need to have some basic Java programming skills to be able to go through this course.If you’ve been through at least some of the Java Masterclass on Udemy (created by one of the instructors in this course) or similar Java training, then you will have no problem going through the course.Who are the instructors?Your instructors are Tim Buchalka and Goran Lochert.  Both have many years of commercial programming experience using the technologies taught in the course.Tim has been working with Java for 18 years, and Goran is both Spring certified and Oracle Java certified. They have a number of very successful Udemy courses, including Tim’s Java Masterclass and Goran’s Oracle Java Certification course.Here’s what’s important. There’re lot of people teaching Spring who are not developers. We’re developers with many years’ experience with JEE and Spring, who also teach Spring.And you guessed it. Learning Spring the “wrong way” is not only a wasted opportunity, it may harm your career in the long run.  If you don’t follow industry best practices when creating Spring projects, you not going to fit in well with a future employer.Because you are working with career professional developers, you will learn Spring 5 the right way in this course.What if you have questions?
As if this course wasn’t complete enough, we offer full support, answering any questions you have 7 days a week (whereas many instructors answer just once per week, or not at all). 
This means you’ll never find yourself stuck on one lesson for days on end. With our hand-holding guidance, you’ll progress smoothly through this course without any major roadblocks. 
That’s just one reason why Tim was voted top 10 in the  Udemy instructor awards (out of a whopping 18,000 instructors), and quickly became a top-rated, bestselling instructor on the Udemy site.  
Student Quotes: “I loved the course because the instructor was really good and explained everything + the support team is really quick in answering our questions the course is worth buying, and i would suggest people to buy it.” –Hamza ShahidThere’s no risk either!
This course comes with a full 30 day money-back guarantee. Meaning if you are not completely satisfied with the course or your progress, simply let Tim or J-P know and they will refund you 100%, every last penny no questions asked.
You either end up with Spring framework skills, go on to develop great programs and potentially make an awesome career for yourself, or you try the course and simply get all your money back if you don’t like it… 
You literally can’t lose.

In fact, Spring is the most popular Java framework.
Did you know, a core reason for Spring's popularity with companies is it's IoC engine?
A typical company will deploy their Spring Framework application in at least 3 different environments. Having a development, test, and production environment is common.
The problem developers face is each environment is different. 
In this course you will learn how to use Spring's IoC container to deploy your application in many different environments. Through Inversion of Control, your Spring application can wire itself for the needs of each environment.
You'll start the course learning advanced configuration options of the Spring Framework. 
Next, the course takes a DevOps approach. You'll see how to deploy Spring Framework applications in different environments.
In development, it's common to use a H2 in memory database. Of course, this database is only temporary. Not something you'd want to use for your production deployment.
Do you want to see how to flip a switch and use MySQL? Flip another switch and your app can be using a RDS database managed Amazon. You can do this with no code changes.
The course also looks as best practices used in enterprise software development. 
Using a continuous integration server is a best practice. Jenkins is the most popular CI server. You will learn how to install Jenkins on a Linux server. A server you provisioned in the AWS cloud.
Once you have Jenkins running on your AWS server a best practice is to setup Jenkins on a friendly URL.
Jenkins is a Java application running on port 8080. You don't want to be typing some IP colon 8080 into your browser to reach Jenkins.
Want to know how you can use Apache and Route 53 to reach your Jenkins server your own URL? To a domain you own?
Docker is an exciting technology. You will see how to leverage Docker to host your own Artifactory Maven repository. We'll use Artifactory to manage build artifacts produced by Jenkins.
Just for fun, we will also use Docker to setup a MySQL database server. We'll do this by provisioning a Linux server on AWS, installing Docker on it, and then deploy MySQL in a Docker container.
We'll also provision an application server we can use to run our Spring Boot application. You will pull the Spring Boot jar right from Artifactory and tell it to connect to database server.
Amazon AWS also has managed MySQL databases. This is their RDS service. You will see how to provision your own RDS database. We'll then reconfigure our Spring Boot application to connect to the RDS database.
There is a lot of fun and challenging content in this course. You will learn:
This is a very hands on course. To get the most out of this course, you will need an account on AWS. You should be able to use the AWS free tier to complete the course assignments.
To get the most out of this course, you will  need a domain name. You will need to have control of the domain. Without this, you will not be able to configure subdomains in Route 53.
The course does leverage AWS for their cloud services. The skills you learn on the AWS platform will transfer to most corporate environments. AWS is used to mimic the typical company.
There is a lot of exciting content in this course! 
DevOps is not an easy area. Many different technologies are involved. 
In this course, you will see how easy it is to manage Spring Framework applications in complex corporate environments."

The first thing that is going to stand out is that we are going to move away from the boring, non-useful demos. In the new course, we are going to build a practical application from start to finish.
While we are creating this application together we will take a look at some of the new features Spring Framework 5 & Spring Boot 2 have to offer. By taking this course you will have the latest skills that you need to build real applications using the Spring Framework.

What is Spring Boot?
Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can ""just run"".
Spring Boot takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

Build anything with Spring Boot
Spring Boot is the starting point for building all Spring-based applications. Spring Boot is designed to get you up and running as quickly as possible, with minimal upfront configuration of Spring.
Get started in seconds using Spring Initializr
Build anything - REST API, WebSocket, Web, Streaming, Tasks, and more
Simplified Security
Rich support for SQL and NoSQL
Embedded runtime support - Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow
Developer productivity tools such as live reload and auto restart
Curated dependencies that just work
Production-ready features such as tracing, metrics and health status
Works in your favorite IDE - Spring Tool Suite, IntelliJ IDEA and NetBeans"

The technologies we will cover are (but not limited to) Spring Boot, Spring Core, Spring MVC, Spring Data, JPA,MySQL, Thymeleaf, Gradle, and Spring Test. At the end of this course, you will learn to integrate all these technologies so that you can start working on implementing your own idea with Spring 4.  
  	As you follow through the course lectures, you will also find the codes in the corresponding github repository that I mention in the course. This is part one of the course but it shows a complete working project. I am working on Part 2 and will make that available as I'm done with it.  "

In Spring Core, I gave you a solid foundation in working with the Spring Framework. In this course, I build upon that foundation expanding your skills with the Spring Framework. The skills taught in this course are skills you will need for enterprise application development using the Spring Framework.
Topics Include:
I start this course by showing students how to replace the traditional JPA DAO structure we created in the Spring Core course, using Spring Data JPA. I continue building upon concepts learned in the Spring Core course by showing students how to use Command objects in Spring MVC and how to perform server side property validations.

Next we get into using Spring Security. Spring Security is one of the most widely used modules of the Spring Framework. 
I show you how to add Spring Security to our existing Spring MVC web application. We configure Spring Security to read user information from our database, and then secure URLs to authenticated users and users with specific security roles.
Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) is a really cool programming paradigm, and its supported by the Spring Framework. In the module on AOP, I show you how to use AOP to log login activity in Spring Security. By using AOP, we don't need to change any of the Spring Security code.
The Spring Framework has a very mature events framework we can use for application events. I show you how to create a custom application event, then how to setup an event handler to take action on specific application events.
In Spring Core and in this course, the project we're working uses Spring Boot as its foundation. Spring Boot is doing a lot of automatic configuration for us. 
In the last module of this course, we will remove Spring Boot from the project. This will require us to configure all the objects and data sources being provided by Spring Boot manually. In doing so, students will gain insight into all the automation being provided by Spring Boot, and how to manage a more advanced Spring Configuration."

In big enterprises, as a developer, you write an application and then turn it over to another team. Someone else promotes your code into QA and then the operations guys eventually take your code to production.
Out of sight, out of mind right?
Wrong. Not so much anymore. The age of DevOps has really brought developers and operations closer together.
Spring Boot has introduced a tremendous amount of functionality to the Spring Framework. If you are building modern Spring Framework applications, you're probably already using Spring Boot.
An awesome feature of Spring Boot is Spring Boot Actuator. 
If you're a developer, Spring Boot Actuator brings you a set of tools you want to be using to help people in operations monitor your application.
Spring Boot Actuator is all about supporting and monitoring your application running production.
If you're in operations, Spring Boot Actuator is a set of tools you want your developers to enable in their Spring Boot projects.
Spring Boot Actuator is a set of tools for monitoring and managing Spring Boot Applications as they run in production.
As the industry moves towards microservices deployed in containers, automated monitoring becomes more and more important.
Out of the box Spring Boot Actuator provides a health endpoint which can easily be wired into container orchestration tools, such as Kubernetes or Open Shift, which can be used to trigger alerting or automated self-healing.
But Spring Boot Actuator is much more than just a simple health end point.
In this course you will learn:
When things go wrong in production, wouldn't it be nice to know exactly what version of your code is running?
With Spring Boot Actuator, it's simple to add information from your Git checkin or your Jenkins CI build. Then, you can go to the information endpoint and know exactly what version of the code is running in production.
As you troubleshoot a problem, sometimes you need to see more detailed log output. If you're running in production, your logging levels are probably turned down to keep the logging overhead at a minimum.
What you need is a way to shell into your running application and change the log levels.
In this course, you will see exactly how you can shell into your running application to adjust the log levels.
If you're deploying Spring Boot applications in today's enterprise, Spring Boot Actuator is really a must have."

In the course, Spring Boot – Getting Started, you have learned the basic knowledge to create an application with spring boot. This course will build on that and extend it even further. We are also going to dive deeper into Spring security and store users in the database, use distributed sessions, and our own user classes. You’ll learn how to test Spring WebMVC applications and how to include your Spring security configuration in your tests.

We are also having a look at Spring Data which we have only covered briefly in the database section before. AOP allows you to effectively tackle the famous cross-cutting concerns, so we are having a look at Spring support for AOP. As last section we are adopting Spring boot Actuator to our needs by adding our own metrics and health checks and revisit the Actuator configuration.

After completing this course you will be able to use the advanced Spring Boot features to deliver more complex, feature rich, and operations-friendly applications.

What is Reactive Programming?
What is Functional Reactive Programming?
Functional Reactive Programming is the most significant feature introduced in Spring Framework 5. It is an important paradigm shift which allows you effectively work with streams of data.
In this course you will learn about one of the hottest trends in the Java community!
We'll start off the course talking about what are Reactive Streams, and why the Reactive Streams API has been included in Java 9.
Next, you'll get hands on experience with building a Reactive application to stream 'movie events' leveraging the Reactive data types and WebFlux - both new to Spring Framework 5. 
In order to truly master Reactive Programming with Spring Framework 5, you must have a solid understanding of the Functional Programming features of the Java programming language. 
Java 8 provided us the Streams API. We dive into the Java 8 Streams API and explore how closely related it is to the new Reactive data types in Spring Framework 5.
Once you have a solid understanding of Reactive Programming, you'll start diving into Reactive Programming with Spring Framework 5.

Cloud-based infrastructure was a game changer for software development and serverless architectures is the next step in that evolution. Building serverless applications means that your developers can focus on their core product instead of worrying about managing and operating servers or runtimes, either in the cloud or on-premises. Many companies have started adopting serverless architecture for their applications to save costs and improve scalability. This course demonstrates a key strength of serverless computing in AWS using Spring.
This course will introduce you to Serverless Architecture and lead you to build a simple image-resizing service using a Java-based AWS Lambda function. Then we’ll move onto how the Spring framework supports the cloud and in particular AWS. There are a number of different services made available through Spring annotations to make your life easier. 
Moving on, you’ll start to build your Spring-based, serverless application that will take a URL and convert it into a short URL that will be stored in DynamoDB and you’ll receive a short URL. You can then use that short URL in a browser and then be redirected to the real site. To demonstrate integration with AWS’ Simple Notification Service (SNS), the application will also send a notification to you whenever someone creates a new short URL. Lastly, you’ll learn about monitoring your application using AWS cloud watch.
By the end of the course, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge to build scalable and cost-efficient Spring applications with serverless architectures.

In this course you will learn how to test Java and Spring Boot applications using highly popular open source tools. 
You will see in the first section of this course, the software testing ecosystem is very diverse. JUnit and Mockito are two of the leading testing libraries for Java. JUnit provides the test execution context, while Mockito give you power mocking capabilities. Together these libraries can be used to write unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests. You will also learn why having proper test coverage is critical to supporting other popular agile practices such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (aka CI/CD).
Agile teams all over the world consider Test Driven Development (TDD) a critical technique for producing quality software. This course begins by using JUnit 5 to demonstrate how to use TDD to create a simple Java application, then again using TDD to evolve the application to a higher level of quality and functionality. 
Next, the course takes you into a deep dive of the features and functionality of JUnit 5. You will learn how to write JUnit 5 unit tests for a Java web application. 
The primary focus of this course is on the JUnit 5 release. There are some very notable differences between JUnit 4 and JUnit 5. This course contains a dedicated section showing you how to migrate your JUnit 4 tests to JUnit 5.
As your testing needs become more complex, you will need to mock dependent objects. Mockito is the most popular mocking library used by Java developers. 
If you are writing Spring Framework applications, you're likely to be injecting dependent objects into your classes. You will learn how to use the robust mocking capabilities of Mocktio to mock dependent objects in your unit tests."

to become a Spring Developer with lots of high-demand skillsets in your
toolbox? Do you want to learn how Spring Framework and Spring Boot works? You
should definitely join me where we will be diving deep into the Spring
Framework and Spring Boot and develop Spring MVC, Spring Data, Spring REST
applications and much more starting from scratch!

List of
technologies we will cover in this course is huge. Covering everything with
Spring technology stack, to combine all the technologies we learned, we will
buid a full-featured, production-grade Spring MVC CRUD application where we
will use Spring Data, Spring REST, Spring MVC, Thymeleaf, HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap! So we
will also get a taste of UI and Front-End development too with Spring!

First, we
will start by setting up our development environment. To set things up, I will
show you how you can prepare your environment both on Windows and MacOS. We'll
then learn and understand how Spring Framework and Spring Boot works. We will
discover the architecture of Spring Framework and Spring Boot and how
everything amazingly work together and handled by the framework itself. We will
make use of Spring Initializr to create all of our applications and I will
teach you how you can make the most out of it. We will use both use IDE version
of Spring Initializr and also start dot spring dot io. We will also learn to how to
build and package our application with Maven. Then we will start by developing
our first Spring Boot application! After our first application, we will start
digging into Spring Boot more and learn how Dependency Injection(DI) and
Inversion of Control(IoC) works. Learning DI and IoC is a crucial process in
learning how Spring works and to actually work with it. When we understand DI
and IoC, we will discover the world of Spring Profiles and Spring
Configuration. We will activate profiles and learn how to configure our
application for our specific needs.

When we
grasp the inner workings of Spring, we will start developing our first web
application with Spring MVC and Thymeleaf. When we're implementing, you will
understand what each and every component is and how to handle static content
like Javascript, CSS, Images and much more in our application. Most
importantly, you will understand what templating is and how to dinamicaly bind
data to HTML pages.

After we
finish our first Spring MVC application, we will learn and understand how
Spring Data and JPA works and to actually implement them, we will connect to
databases, create entities and repositories and persist data with Spring Data
and JPA.

On top of
Spring Data, we will build a RESTful API following the standards in the
real-world use-cases. We will create controllers and implement all the
important HTTP operations such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. After finishing
our implementation, we will take safety measures for our RESTful API and
implement ControllerAdvice and error-handling. After handing errors for our
RESTful API, we will take a step back and refactor our code.
 
When we
finish developing our RESTful API, we will take a bold step ahead and combine
all the knowledge we had throughout the course to develop a full-featured
Spring MVC CRUD application with a beautiful UI! We'll make use of Spring Boot,
Spring Data, Spring REST, Spring MVC, Thymeleaf, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and
much more!
 
We are not
done yet! At the end of ""Bring it All Together"" section. We will move
on with ""Extras"" section where we will discover lots of other great
technologies and libraries we can use in our applications. To see our changes
in any application and most importantly in web applications, we will discover
Spring Dev Tools and Live Reload. We will also nicely document our RESTful API
with Swagger where we can navigate and interact with our API. To understand the
metrics of our application, we will discover Spring Actuator and kepp track of
everything going on with our application. We will also learn another cool
feature of Spring as it is the Spring Scheduler. With Spring Scheduler, it is
really easy to schedule and trigger actions for specific timelines in any
application. Then we will discover the beauty of Project Lombok to get rid of
lots of boilerplate code in our application. And finaly, we will combine
Thymeleaf with Spring Email capabilities to template and deliver HTML5 emails
from our application. 
 
Finally, do
not forget that Udemy offers you the lifetime access to course contents from
either desktop, tablet and your mobile. By taking this course, you can learn
Spring technologies anywhere at your own pace and play again and again to grasp
every single detail!
 
Again, we
have a huge list of technologies that we are going to cover in this course. Spring is in huge demand these days thanks to Spring Boot and all of its
offerings. If you want to jumpstart your career with Spring then join me in this
course and take a huge step forward for becoming an amazing Spring
Developer! "

There are already innumerable courses/tutorials on internet/Udemy which teaches almost every aspects of C programming language. All those courses sounds same, talk same and deliver more or less same knowledge. How is this course different from others ? 

The intention of this course is to make you ready for System programming Technical interviews, interview level - from Beginner to Intermediate. This course is for (future) Developers, not for testers or system Administrators.

I choose to create this course to fill the gap between novice/beginner and intermediate/Advanced Programmers. This course assumes that you are at-least above average in programming (in any programming language, but preferable in C/C++) - know memory allocations, all kinds of loops, function calls, pointers etc.  In this course, I wont teach C/C++ (there are already many courses on it online), but would teach programming techniques and low level details regarding how C program works behind the scenes - All topics very important from interview point of view. My Target is to grow this course into Linux/C Bible.

Yet, I always feel, you need to outsmart your fellow colleagues in this era of stiff competition, and therefore, I tried this attempt to present you the wisdom  and knowledge which is of utmost importance for a programmer. I have seen though students could write good C/C++ programs, yet they lacks the clarity on how one should write better organized, Manageable, extensible and programmable codes in the form of libraries. For example, Student too good in competitive programming, yet do not know how to write a simple Makefile, reason being, Academics do not teach and students do not care to learn. 
In this course, I will cover the topics related to creating Linux System Libraries (release 1) with Advanced language agnostic Programming Concepts (release 2) which can be well applied if you happen to become a programmer in other languages tomorrow. 

The Concepts like MultiThreading, Thread-Synchronization, Socket Programming, IPCs etc demands a separate course on each topic altogether. Currently, I have a course on IPC, pls check it out. These topics  are out of scope of this course. 

The Course shall be delivered into two Releases : 

     Release 1 Building and Managing a Library :  This covers basics regarding how one should create and organize his code as a Library.
     Release 2 Advance Programming Concepts :  More sections shall be added in this course. This covers Advance concepts on Linux and C. Please check Table of Contents for more info.
The further content of this course is under fast development. Weekly at-least one section shall be added. 

Why you should *NOT* do this course ?
1. Please Excuse this course if you are ultimate beginner in C programming !!
2. There is no point of doing this course if you don't like hitting keyboard, and lazy enough to watch lecture VDOs only
3. If you want everything cooked and served on your plate. 

Course Pre-requisite :
Above Beginners Level in C/C++ programming
Good to have basic OS knowledge
Zeal to excel and Code

No Third Party libraries
Whatever logic you implement, you need to implement it from scratch. Like all my other courses, this course do not suggest taking help of any third party library to get the jobs done. Use of external libraries completely defeats the purpose of the course.

Are you tired of searching the web for a ready-made script, hoping that it will fix your problem? Want to sit back and relax for a couple of seconds while your script performs the task that would have taken you two hours to accomplish manually? Then you have come to the right course!
This course will help you build your own scripts and understand the ones written by others. No more relying on scripts that others built and hoping that they will solve your custom problems. Just writing your own solutions to your own problems.
Take this course to get:

In short, you will learn the basic building blocks of bash, watch how a real-life utility is built, do the monthly challenges and solve coding problems in the discussion area to gain experience (did I mention the prizes?).
The first section covers basic building blocks that allow you to write your own shell scripts, which are presented in a learn-by-example fashion. Here you will learn about basic linux command line utilities used throughout the course, a simple script structure, defining functions, using input/output redirection, pipes and command substitution. The last lectures in this section focus on control statements, like if, case, while and for.
In the second section I will show you how to build a simple real-life utility for monitoring the amount of traffic on a network interface. There are two scripts involved in this utility. The ""core"", that queries system data about a network interface and adds it to a comma-separated-values (csv) file, one line at a time. The other one will take care of scheduling the ""core"" to be run at specific times, based on a user specified interval. The result is a csv file that contains data collected at specific points in time, data that can be later processed into a spreadsheet application (e.g. build graphs from it).
The rest of the course, what I call the dynamic part, is built in time. You will find here lectures on various command line utilities (e.g. find) or more in-depth lectures on subjects like redirection. I also post monthly challenges for you to gain some much needed experience, in order to ascend from a beginner to an intermediate level.

The problem is that if you want to get really good with Vim it can take you an extremely long time if you're trying to learn it on your own.
That's why the Vim Masterclass was created.
This course gives you the absolute shortest path to learning the basics. It also provides you the fastest way to learn the most advanced features, too.
By the time you finish the Vim Masterclass you'll know how to:
Work with multiple files, including how to move data back and forth between different files, copying & pasting from one file to another, and quickly jumping to another file.  You'll also learn how to view multiple files at the same time using Vim's windowing system.
Use the must-know keyboard shortcuts and how to remember them easily.  You'll actually learn how to ""think in Vim"" so you don't even have to memorize each and every command, saving you countless hours of work.
Find and replace entire blocks of information within a file.  That includes how to refactor your code by renaming all variables in a file or set of files, reliably.  Of course, you'll learn simple find and replace techniques to replace a word in an entire file and much more.
Cut, copy and paste.  You'll find out how to make the most of Vim's built-in clipboard system, use Vim's clipboard history, and how to access your system's clipboard from within Vim.
Visually select blocks of text and perform edits on those blocks like moving the block, deleting the block, indenting/shifting the block, and more.  You'll understand Vim's text objects so you can quickly select single or multiple words, lines, paragraphs, HTML/XML tags, code blocks, and more.
How to make vertical edits and use Vim's Visual Block Mode.  (Some call this column editing mode or rectangle mode…)
Enable syntax highlighting for source code, configuration files, or any type of file you edit often.  That includes how to customize the color scheme and color code text in Vim.
Employ simple to advanced navigation techniques so you can go exactly to where you need in a file very fast.
Practical application tips such as how to edit source code, scripts, HTML, and more.  You'll find lots of opportunities for practice in this course.
Use MacVim and gVim on Linux and Windows.  This includes learning the advantages and disadvantages of both the textual interface and the graphical interfaces to Vim.
Create, save, and replay macros to normalize data and quickly repeat complicated edits.  You'll learn how to append or prepend text to every line in a text file, how to format one line of text and apply that formatting to a specified area in the file and more.  In short, you'll learn how to automate everything in Vim.
Create custom shortcuts and personalized key mappings.  If you want to create a shortcut for something you do often, you'll find out how to make your life a whole lot easier.
Indent and shift blocks of text.  You'll also learn how to enable auto indentation so you can quickly clean up and prettify your source code.
And more...
When you start the course, you'll be able to use vim almost immediately.  I want to make sure you get up and running as quickly as possible.  That's why at the beginning of the course you'll learn how to start vim, how to make simple edits, and how to save your changes.
After that, we'll build on your knowledge and even get into some really advanced techniques such as editing multiple files at once, creating macros, making global substitutions in many files at the same time, ways to format and normalize data, how to ""think in vim"", and much more.
Having taught thousands of students over the years, I know people learn best by doing. That's why I've packed this course with tons of practice exercises.  For each exercise you, get detailed, step-by-step instructions.  I encourage you to try the labs on your own first.  Then I walk through the exercise while you look over my shoulder.
Not only will you learn the concepts, you'll watch me demonstrate how to put those concepts to good use, and you'll practice those new skills immediately so that you really understand and retain what you're learning.
This course is ideal for anyone who works on the command line often.  Whether you're a system administrator, a developer, a database administrator, or anyone else who has to edit files in a command line environment, this course is for you.
Even though this course does cover the graphical version of vim, it is NOT for people who are looking for ""what you see is what you get"" (WYSIWYG) word processing help.
No, this course is for people who want to get really efficient at editing plain text files, such as server configuration files, shell scripts, source code, and any other type of textual data.
So, if you're tired of being scared of vim, or just aren't making the progress you'd hope to by just dabbling in vim, it's time to take your vim skills to the next level by enrolling in this course.

God’s sake! It’s so simple to get lost in that ocean of technologies. You need to understand the overall picture to feel comfortable today. Didn’t you feel like a small fish in the ocean last time? Well, I did. I questioned myself, ""what the hell is going on around me?"" I didn’t quite understand the directions in which technologies develop. I didn’t know what to expect, what to learn next. In such situation, you feel helpless. And what we are going to do in the course is that we’re going to eliminate this nasty feeling of being helpless by learning all the most important notions in the modern .NET platform.
Teaching Approach

A big part of the problem is a lack of resources and limited understanding of how to integrate these 2 awesome technologies, Angular on the front-end and ASP.Net Core on the back-end.
The big problem, is that the industry has always tried to simplify the solution by compartmentalizing the technologies. But knowing how to integrate technologies is the key to performance, and making an application easy to maintain. This mean you must have a good understanding of the backend technologies, the development environment, as well as the frontend technologies.
Why do you think Microsoft seems behind in the integration of Angular on the front-end? Hmm… Could it be that the newer technologies have us dropping down to the command line? Why do we need to drop down to the command line anyway? Could it be the only way to be compatible across multiple platforms? Are there Microsoft developers that like to drop down to the command line? Can I do my complete development, without dropping down to the command line? Watch this course, and I will show you how!"

This course provides a comprehensive overview of Design Patterns in C# and .NET from a practical perspective. This course in particular covers patterns with the use of:
This course provides an overview of all the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns as outlined in their seminal book, together with modern-day variations, adjustments, discussions of intrinsic use of patterns in the language.
What are Design Patterns?
Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems. They were popularized with the 1994 book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson and Richard Helm (who are commonly known as a Gang of Four, hence the GoF acronym).
The original book was written using C++ and Smalltalk as examples, but since then, design patterns have been adapted to every programming language imaginable: C#, Java, PHP and even programming languages that aren't strictly object-oriented, such as JavaScript.
The appeal of design patterns is immortal: we see them in libraries, some of them are intrinsic in programming languages, and you probably use them on a daily basis even if you don't realize they are there.
What Patterns Does This Course Cover?
This course covers all the GoF design patterns. In fact, here's the full list of what is covered:
Who Is the Course For?
This course is for .NET/C# developers who want to see not just textbook examples of design patterns, but also the different variations and tricks that can be applied to implement design patterns in a modern way. For example, the introduction of the DLR allows us to use an ImpromptuObject, so that our DynamicObject exposes any interface we desire. This allows for dynamic programming, and many design patterns are presented in terms of their static and DLR-based variations.
Presentation Style
This course is presented as a (very large) series of live demonstrations being done in Microsoft Visual Studio. Most demos are single-file, so you can download the file attached to the lesson and run it in Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Rider or another IDE of your choice.
This course does not use UML class diagrams; all of demos are live coding. I use Visual Studio, various NuGet packages, R# unit test runner and even dotMemoryUnit.

Assuming no knowledge of ASP.NET or ASP.NET MVC, we will create a data-driven blog engine from scratch. This 14 hour series is all you need to get started quickly with building real, production-ready, web applications using Microsoft’s .NET framework.  
  	 ASP.NET MVC is one of the most popular web development frameworks today. It is built and maintained by Microsoft, and provides us with a lean, modern environment for making our web development projects a reality. In addition, the tooling support from Visual Studio is second to none.  
  	 Finally, ASP.NET MVC allows us to develop web applications using any .NET language. We will be using the expressive, powerful, and modern language C#. Although there are other web development frameworks available for .NET, ASP.NET MVC is a first class citizen in the .NET ecosystem - giving it a powerful edge over alternatives.  
  	 This series is organized in a project-focused manner. We will build up a simple blog engine that supports users, roles, posts and tags.  
  	 The straightforward and well understood nature of a product like this allows us to focus on what matters: ASP.NET MVC. Building a complete, production-ready product from scratch makes our content much more interesting and fluid, and, above all else: practical.  
  	 This series goes over the most important features of ASP.NET MVC: routing, areas, asset bundling, controllers, the Razor view engine, data binding and validation. We also will be using the mature and very powerful nHibernate OR/M to access our database; and the Fluent Migrator database migration framework to version our database schema in source control. In this series we also take a look at security issues - from CSRF and XSS attacks, to making sure our errors aren’t displayed to our customers.  
  	 Although this is not a frontend web development series, we will be using both jQuery and Bootstrap 3 to substantially speed up our development and provide a modern, sleek, user interface for our product. The foundation we lay can serve as a launching point for your own design needs.  
  	 If that isn't enough, we also take a look at deployment to a real Windows server. In addition to configuring IIS and showing how to run our migrations to populate its schema - we introduce Web Deploy. Web Deploy is a product that allows us to publish our web application right from inside of Visual Studio (or even a command line tool if you wish to integrate this with your Continuous Integration server). We install Web Deploy on the Windows server, show some common pitfalls and get everything up and running from inside of Visual Studio.  
  	 All code in this series can be written using the free express editions of Visual Studio 2012 or later. The deployment process outlined in this series can be applied to Windows Server 2012 - but can also be used with normal, desktop versions of Windows for development purposes.  
  	 We will also be using MySQL as our database. In addition, to manage our database, we use the free MySQL Workbench product that is available via the same MySQL installer that includes the database itself. We assume that Visual Studio, MySQL and MySQL workbench are installed on your machine.  
  	 We also assume an understanding of C# up to basic object orientation. We won’t be using any advanced features of the language, except for our limited use of LINQ to query our database.  "

help you learn everything you need to know about ASP.NET Core 2.0
Framework!


ASP.Net
Core 2 is the next generation open-source framework to help build
dynamic cross-platform websites. With the ASP.Net Core 2, Microsoft
has tried to create an amazing platform that is fast, flexible, and
modern.


However,
learning ASP.Net Core 2 is not exactly easy, especially with a
textbook approach at the subject matter. This is why we have designed
a complete hands-on course that deviates away from just focusing on
theory learning, but instead takes a hand-on approach to ASP.Net.


The
course starts at the very beginning and is also designed keeping in
mind newbie students who have no experience with ASP.Net framework.
It will focus on building up the fundamentals and teach you
everything you need to know to start building you very own ASP.Net
Core 2 application.


Taking
it a step further, the instructor will also take you step-by-step to
actually build four different projects from scratch that will help
you learn the subject by doing. The first section of the course
covers a detailed overview of ASP.Net Core 2, including a comparison
between core 1.0 and web pages, as well as how this core version has
improved cross-platform development. 



The
following 4 sections include different projects that cover simple
applications such as a contact form that uses Razor Pages which lets
you send emails, where you will also learn how to integrate the form
with a GMAIL account. The second project will show you how to create
a Web API that allows the developers to hit using RESTful resources
on the application. 



The
third project will see you build a Shopping Cart from scratch which
teaches you how to integrate the app with a database using the entity
framework to accomplish that. We will also see how to retain
information in the shopping cart as well allow users to modify their
cart. In the final project, we will build an Authorized User Web App
that is going to use the identity framework to build out all the

Who should join:
0. This is a course for those who are willing to push themselves. It's not a ""basic"" introduction that gives an overly simplified perspective on VB. In places, this code connects to the .NET framework, which is a professional level code base written in C#.  My promise is simple: take this course, and you'll discover details not taught in any other course.  Speaking from experience, I can tell you that it is through consistent, daily effort, and I don't mean little effort, but whole-hearted effort, that one makes progress when it comes to these technical subjects. That's what years of struggling have taught me. 
1. This course uses the latest preview version of Visual Studio 2017
2.  This course jumps into object oriented programming early so you can see real VB as soon as possible.
3. This course provides detailed explanations, so please be sure you enjoy fine detail before enrolling
4. If you are looking for fast, superficial explanations, and five minutes videos, this course will NOT help you
5.  There are videos on what happens in your computer memory and how the .NET Framework and C# connect to VB.NET
6. When I delve into the .NET Framework source code, you will also see C# in operation, and therefore the code will be complex. 
7. Clear, crisp audio done with a studio microphone
8. Review questions are now embedded directly into the videos at different points, and there many of them in the videos
9. You will not see videos on things like printing 1,2,3,4,5 using a loop because this has little practical value
10. You will see more practical videos on things like using loops to read files/write files 
11. The videos are straightforward code examples, with no talking head or distracting graphics
12. Some of my explanations step through the code line by line using the debugger,  so if you are impatient, this likely will not work for you
13. There is a text editor project on the bottom
14. You also learn about the practical implications of polymorphism and interfaces
15. I also show you how to use a variety of features in Visual Studio 2017
16. You can adjust the playback speed on the player very easily to 0.5, 0.75, 1.25,1.5 and 2 times the regular speed so you can learn at a pace that truly works for you
Who Should Not Join:
1. People who want to learn VB.NET through console programs
2. Those who are not ready to be exposed to object-oriented programming
3. People who want five minute videos would not be the right fit for this course
4. People who do not enjoy detailed explanations would not be the right fit for this course
5. People who do not want to answer review questions would not be the right fit for this course
6. People who are not willing to do whatever it takes  to push their skills higher"

Take your enterprise software design and development to the next level with building Microservices using the new .NET CORE 3.x and Amazon Web Services.
Monolithic applications which include all the services of a software system in a big and complex application are becoming outdated fast. It is essential that software engineers master the concepts, patterns and details of implementing their future applications using Microservices. 
Working on projects that were based on Microservices, I could not find a resource which actually would teach me how to implement a system based on Microservices. Everybody talks about what Microservices are but nobody tells us how to build one! The few books that are out there have the same problem, plus they are too broad and so fail to hold the developers' hand and take them through the journey.
In this course we try to be more specific and avoid being too generic by focusing on .NET CORE 3.x and Amazon Web Services. Amazon Web Services has improved massively in the past year or so by introducing plenty of services that cater for Microservice-based applications, and so it is a great choice for our course. 
To master implementing Microservices we will build an ASP.NET CORE 3 project called ""Web Advertisements"". It will be based on Microservice patterns, and will use Amazon Web services for security, messaging, storage, service discovery and so forth. I will code the project in the course so you will see that how a Microservice is built, line by line!
You will need to have basic to elementary knowledge of C# and ASP.NET MVC. If you have ever used a couple of AWS services such as EC2 or S3 then you are all good for joining the course. 
Questions are always welcome from students and can be asked in the Q&A section of the course. I endeavor to respond to these quickly so I can create an engaging learning environment for my students.  
The course includes 70+ topics and 
Buckle up and be ready for the WOW that is expecting you in this course. I look forward to seeing you with us in this fun journey!

An open-source, cross-platform, high performance flavor of the .NET framework was created: this is .NET Core. Additionally, C#, the most widely used .NET programming language also evolved over the years. These new developments include many performance improvements.
The goal of the course is to give you deep understanding about these performance improvements. By applying the knowledge from this course, you will be able to measure and optimize the performance of .NET Core (including ASP.NET Core), C# applications.
After a short wrap-up on .NET Core the course introduces you to the first pillar of the performance topic: measuring performance. You will learn to use tools that you can apply to measure the performance of your code running on .NET Core. Then we will focus on some important performance tricks like reducing the pressure on the GC by using value types or choosing the right collection for the given problem. After that we will see what the compiler does behind the scenes when it compiles your C# 7 code and what performance implications this has. We will talk about some new performance related APIs like ArrayPool and Span and we will also look into the performance aspects of Entity Framework Core. We will talk about the ahead of time compilation story for .NET with CrossGen and IL trimming with the .NET IL Linker. We will finish the course by learning about production performance monitoring for .NET Core. 

Goal of the course 

Course style
The course is a mix of theory and practice. Tools and concepts with their theoretical background will be introduced with slides and then the theoretical knowledge will be applied in demos.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

1- Does this course cover ASP.NET Core 1.0? 
No! Once you master ASP.NET MVC 5, you can quickly get up to speed with ASP.NET Core. Mosh has a follow up course on Udemy called ""Build a Real-world App with ASP.NET Core and Angular"". In this course, you'll get up to speed with ASP.NET Core in the context of building a real app from A to Z. 

2- Why should I pay for this course when there are lots of free tutorials available?

Free tutorials and YouTube videos are free for a reason. They introduce you to a few concepts here and there, but soon you'll find yourself jumping from one tutorial to another to fill the missing gaps. By taking a perfectly-structured course, you'll be confident that you're in good hands, right from the beginning all the way through to the very end. You pay for saving your precious time: the time that you can spend on the things you love. 
Plus, many of these free tutorials, including tutorials published by Microsoft on the official ASP.NET website, teach you poor practices. Throughout this course, Mosh points out some of these poor practices and explains in technical terms why you should avoid them.

Course Overview:
Would you like to just acquire core Java skills or would you like to become a complete & professional Java engineer right at the end of this course. If it is the latter, then you should read on ... 
This comprehensive project-based course has been designed with following objectives:
To help you get an in-depth understanding of both core & advanced concepts in Java
To teach best practices & key design principles for writing effective Java programs
To help you gain truly practical experience in writing professional-level code via instructor-led implementation of a project, which is Java EE-based Web application that uses technologies like Servlets, JSP, and JSTL. Project is implemented in Eclipse using MVC pattern, TDD  (Test-Driven Development) principles and other best practices. Project also incorporates few advanced multi-threading concepts and utilizes MySQL database as the back-end and Apache Tomcat as the Web server
Master Object-Oriented Programming concepts like Inheritance, Polymorphism, Interfaces & Abstract Classes via a real-world case-study
Learn about database designing, implementation (SQL), and how to interact interact with them from Java programs (via JDBC)
To help you understand the inner workings of Java platform (aka JVM)
Learn Functional-style programming via Java 8 features like lambda expressions & streams
Learn how to build Web applications using core Java EE technologies like Servlets, JSP, and JSTL
To teach how to effectively use Eclipse IDE to write, debug, and test Java programs

The motivation behind these objectives is to help you in becoming a complete & industry-ready Java engineer. Most Java courses focus only on teaching core fundamentals, which at the very best equip students with good basic skills to work on small-to-medium sized projects. Most of these students fall short when it comes to implementing more complex projects. To design elegant solutions for large, complex projects one needs to have a much deeper understanding of language features along with knowledge of the recommended best practices & design principles. More importantly one needs to know how to put all of these into practice. This comprehensive one-stop project-based course has been designed to equip students with these skills. 
Course Specifics: 
This course begins by giving a birds-eye view of Java covering everything from origin of Java to installing Java and writing your first Java program. Even the most fundamental concepts like compilation & interpretation are explained. All other topics are covered in-depth starting from language basics, object-oriented concepts & design (including Java 8 features like default & static methods in interfaces), JVM, exceptions, IO, data structures, generics, multi-threading, databases, nested classes, enums, functional-style programming via Java 8 constructs like lambda expressions & streams, and also gives a very good basic introduction to Java EE technologies like Servlets, JSP, and JSTL. 
Each lecture has been very carefully crafted. Motivation behind every concept is clearly explained with well thought out examples and nice animations. Object-oriented concepts like inheritance & polymorphism are explained through a real-world case-study, which is also implemented as part of the course project. Every concept has been well-tested through ready-to-run, downloadable demo programs, which are implemented and executed in the course. Every chapter ends with a carefully crafted quiz to test what was learnt. Many chapters also include challenging coding exercises and student solutions are also auto-evaluated via JUnit scripts, i.e., students would instantly know whether their solution is right or wrong. One of the coding exercises is on Sentiment Analysis, which is a hot area in the industry.
The course project involves building a bookmarking Web application that helps users bookmark items like Books, Movies, and Web pages. The project is instructor-led and is implemented using professional coding conventions & best practices. It follows good object-oriented design, incorporates MVC architectural pattern and also uses Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. Java EE stack comprising technologies like Servlets, JSP, and JSTL are used for building the application. Parts of the project use advanced multi-threading capabilities. MySQL is used as the database and database designing is also explained in detail. Eclipse IDE is used for developing the entire project. There is also a separate dedicated chapter just for learning Eclipse IDE, which would give you a solid foundation in using Eclipse to effectively write, debug, and test Java programs. The chapter includes lessons to use Eclipse's debugger & JUnit unit testing framework.
 
Finally, the course also discusses over half of the best practices/design rules outlined in the popular Effective Java book. Many rules are actually demonstrated in code. This is one of the highlights of the course and will make you truly complete!

About the Instructor & On His Motivation for Building This Course:
I have around 15 years of experience in Java developing complex data integration &  mining software for start-ups in silicon valley and elsewhere. After  working for so many years with many excellent engineers, I realized that  sometimes we fell short of developing the most effective solutions to  some of the problems we were dealing with. This sometimes led to several  rounds of refactoring resulting in loss of valuable time. This made me realize that it was a result of not being taught Java programming in the  right way. I realized that a more holistic approach to teaching Java is needed where the language features are taught along with best  practices & design principles that any serious developer must know.  This course is a result of this realization and it has taken me over 4 years of full-time effort (considered equivalent to over a decade if working on a part-time basis) in developing it. Building this course itself has been a wonderful journey  for me and I hope you will also find this course to be equally  enriching. I will continue to devote myself in building this course  towards making it one of the best Java courses out there. Always, feel free to message me if you have any questions and I promise to address them as quickly as I can (almost always well within a day :)).

Computing resources can be created and destroyed simply by calling an API. Entire virtual data centers can be created in a matter of minutes or hours. 
Whether your company or application was born in the cloud or transitioning to the cloud, you need tools to build and manage your infrastructure. Terraform from Hashicorp is one such tool that allows you to declare infrastructure as code in a simple, easy to understand language. 
Managing your infrastructure as code bridges the gap between dev and ops and provides an opportunity to include infrastructure management as part of the development lifecycle. When environments are declared in code they can be shared and used across your organization to provide consistent environments that align with your production environment. 
Managing infrastructure as code also provides a far more robust process for managing and tracking infrastructure since these processes can now be incorporated into CI/CD tooling and other automation processes. 
In this course I will teach you the fundamentals of Terraform using Amazon Web Services as an example. Together we will walk through the basics of Terraform and ultimately create real infrastructure in AWS along the way. 
This course makes use of the AWS Free Tier which offers the general public a certain number of FREE computing hours and storage space for one year. It is recommended that students sign up for an AWS Free Tier account.

Because now it works. With the arrival of cloud computing and multi-core machines - we have enough compute capacity at our disposal to churn large volumes of data and dig out the hidden patterns contained in these mountains of data.
This technology comes in handy, especially when handling Big Data. Today, companies collect and accumulate data at massive, unmanageable rates for website clicks, credit card transactions, GPS trails, social media interactions, and so on. And it is becoming a challenge to process all the valuable information and use it in a meaningful way. This is where machine learning algorithms come into the picture. These algorithms use all the collected “past” data to learn patterns and predict results or insights that help us make better decisions backed by actual analysis.
You may have experienced various examples of Machine Learning in your daily life (in some cases without even realizing it). Take for example 
In all these examples, machine learning is used to build models from historical data, to forecast the future events with an acceptable level of reliability. This concept is known as Predictive analytics. To get more accuracy in the analysis, we can also combine machine learning with other techniques such as data mining or statistical modeling.
This progress in the field of machine learning is great news for the tech industry and humanity in general. But the downside is that there aren’t enough data scientists or machine learning engineers who understand these complex topics.
Well, what if there was an easy to use a web service in the cloud - which could do most of the heavy lifting for us? What if scaled dynamically based on our data volume and velocity?
The answer - is new cloud service from Microsoft called Azure Machine Learning. Azure Machine Learning is a cloud-based data science and machine learning service which is easy to use and is robust and scalable like other Azure cloud services. It provides visual and collaborative tools to create a predictive model which will be ready-to-consume on web services without worrying about the hardware or the VMs which perform the calculations.
The advantage of Azure ML is that it provides a UI-based interface and pre-defined algorithms that can be used to create a training model. And it also supports various programming and scripting languages like R and Python. 
In this course, we will discuss Azure Machine Learning in detail. You will learn what features it provides and how it is used. We will explore how to process some real-world datasets and find some patterns in that dataset.
These are some of the fundamental problems data scientists and engineers struggle with on a daily basis.
This course teaches you how to design, deploy, configure and manage your machine learning models with Azure Machine Learning. The course will start with an introduction to the Azure ML toolset and features provided by it and then dive deeper into building some machine learning models based on some real-world problems 
If you’re serious about building scalable, flexible and powerful machine learning models in the cloud, then this course is for you. 
These data science skills are in great demand, but there’s no easy way to acquire this knowledge. Rather than rely on hit and trial method, this course will provide you with all the information you need to get started with your machine learning projects. 
Startups and technology companies pay big bucks for experience and skills in these technologies They demand data science and cloud engineers make sense of their dormant data collected on their servers  -  and in turn, you can demand top dollar for your abilities. 
You may be a data science veteran or an enthusiast - if you invest your time and bring an eagerness to learn, we guarantee you real, actionable education at a fraction of the cost you can demand as a data science engineer or a consultant.

save their data on the device that they are installed on is becoming 
obsolete and not feasible. With the increased use of mobile devices, it 
is common for applications to offer ways to backup, sync and share data 
in the cloud. 
A type of backend is usually needed where data can be saved 
and manipulated but this requires time, resources and skills to make it 
work. Fortunately, there are several platforms like Backendless and Parse that provide a
 backend that we as developers can integrate with our applications.
This course will introduce the popular Backendless SDK and show 
you how to integrate it with your Android applications in order to save 
application data in the cloud.
Content and Overview of the course
This course will mainly focus on the Backendless SDK, but in order
 to build our final application we will also do some basic Android 
coding. This course includes:
The Backendless SDK makes saving data in the cloud a walk in the 
park. In less than 6 hours, you will be building an application that 
will be able to save data in the cloud in an exciting and fun way!
I am excited to start working with you!"

Some cloud providers are experiencing a growth rate of 50% year over year – which is just astounding. And the reason for this growth is obvious – cloud computing enables ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal effort.
Amazon Web Services is a cloud computing platform that offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, analytics, application, and deployment services that help organizations move faster, lower IT costs, and scale applications. 

  
Ever since its inception - the relational database management systems have gained tremendous popularity across the world. Recently NoSQL databases like MongoDB has also gained a lot of traction - but still, RDBMS remains the de-facto choice of engineers when it comes to storing structured data. According to some estimates - relational databases are used in more than 90% of the software projects out there.

  
With the advent of cloud computing - solution designers and architects had to deal with some unique challenges while attempting to migrate their relational databases to the cloud. You see, relational databases need high-performance hardware and disks to perform at the peak level. But IaaS cloud computing services provide us with virtual servers - which store their data on network connected disks. So to manage relational data in the cloud - we needed a specialized PaaS (platform as a service) which provided adequate hardware and redundancy to relational databases.

  
Amazon Relational Database Service (or Amazon RDS) is a distributed relational database service by Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS RDS is a web service running ""in the cloud"" designed to simplify the setup, operation, and scaling of a relational database for use in applications. Complex administration processes like patching the database software, backing up databases and enabling point-in-time recovery are managed automatically. Scaling storage and compute resources can be performed by a single API call.

  
Introduction of AWS RDS along with its unique features has made it very simple for us to deploy and grow relational databases to a very large scale in the cloud. What's more - the tight integration that exists between most of the AWS services - makes it seamless to deploy multi-tier complex and scalable applications. 

  
This course will give you in-depth knowledge about AWS RDS and demonstrate some key features and guidelines you need to know to get started with it. We will kick things off with an overview of AWS RDS. After covering the basics of AWS RDS - we will dive deep and learn how to setup highly available, scalable and robust relational database clusters which span multiple AWS availability zones.

  
These are some of the fundamental problems Cloud engineers, architects and database administrators struggle with on a daily basis.

  
This course teaches you how to design, deploy, configure and manage your AWS RDS relational databases with AWS RDS. 

  
If you’re serious about building scalable, flexible and robust AWS RDS databases for use in your cloud-based applications, then this course is for you. 

  
These database and Cloud Computing skills are in high demand, but there’s no easy way to acquire this knowledge. Rather than rely on hit and trial method, this course will provide you with all the information you need to get started with your AWS RDS cloud database projects. 

  
Startups and technology companies pay big bucks for experience and skills in these technologies. They demand database and cloud engineers to design, deploy their cloud-based databases  -  and in turn, you can demand top dollar for your abilities. 

  
Do you want the skills and be highly sought after? Do you want your career to touch cloud 9?

Amazon Web Services is incredible but you can still feel like you're becoming an accidental System Administrator trying to set everything up correctly. However, with the right instructions, you can get up and running in a few hours--saving you time, money, and a headache. 
This course will walk you through Amazon's Web Services, with a focus on setting up Django and leveraging their Free Tier to keep your project free (for low-bandwidth uses for one year). We'll start with the very basics of launching and configuring Django on EC2, discussing different ways to connect to your system while keeping it secure, we'll progress to fine tuning your system with fast and efficient content delivery, and finally we'll dive into all the ways that you can scale your system on this incredibly elastic platform. 
A quick note: Amazon Web Services is used by some of the largest websites on the internet, including Netflix and Yelp, as it's extremely scalable, but, it's also a favorite of many entrepreneurs and VC's who know to take advantage of their Free Tier. It's just a great deal.
What this course is:
An easy-to-understand walkthrough on how to host Django using Amazon Web Services which covers: launching a Django-ready server in minutes or optionally launching a ""plain"" Ubuntu server and configuring Django + dependencies manually (see below for server details), setting up and enhancing security, using FTP & SSH to transfer over project files (a sample project is included) securely, serving static (CSS/JS/Image) files from a Django server and leveraging Cloud Storage (S3 and CloudFront CDN) to make your site faster, setting your project up for production, upgrading your instance for immediate performance increases, adding more instances and load balancing them, separating and vertically scaling your database, automatic scaling with cloud monitoring, deploying automatically with Beanstalk, and more. If you're not happy after taking the course, you will absolutely get your money back. 
(Server Configuration Details: Ubuntu Linux 14.04 with Apache, Mod_WSGI, MySQL & Django -- but you can easily switch to Nginx/PostgreSQL, if preferred)
What this course is not:
Amazon has a very wide range (hundreds) of features. If you are looking for help on a particular AWS feature, view the curriculum below to make sure that it's covered. We cover many features but cannot claim to cover everything.
You do not need your own Django project as this course provides a sample for you, however the focus is on hosting and configuring Django not creating projects. If creating Django projects from scratch is an interest, consider downloading my (free) course ""Create Your First Django Website - Fast & Free"" as supplementary to this course.
Every single question that is raised in the discussion panel is responded to, but this may not be the best resource to diagnose your server issues. Keep in mind that Amazon offers all kinds of support that is available 24x7.
I've enjoyed working with Django and AWS these last couple years -- it's what I use for my business -- and I would now like to help more people take advantage of this great offer and incredibly scalable stack.
If you want to save yourself some time, money, and, possibly a headache, use this guide to speed up the process of understanding this powerful, scalable platform - remember, Amazon hosts everyone - from the busiest sites on the net, to startups on the Free Tier.

Fact: cybercrime costs the global economy over $450 billion. Fact: over 1.5 million WordPress sites were hacked in a single day this year due to a single vulnerability. 
Don’t think website security isn’t important. 
Cyber-criminals are out there using sophisticated software to scan the internet for any type of vulnerable website.
Hackers don’t care if your website is big, small, a non-profit, or profit making. A hacked website is worth money to them as they can either extort money from a website owner, or place links or code on the site to support some other type of criminal activity. 
Online security is of paramount importance to every human being on this planet. This course is for everybody. There is very little use of technical terminology or advanced online procedures. Anyone with basic computer skills can protect any WordPress website by following this course.
The course starts with the two biggest causes of hacks on websites and shows you the simple and non-technical ways to protect yourself. The two biggest causes of hacks on WordPress websites are:
I show how to use secure and unguessable passwords that are different on every site.
I continue to explain how to ensure all the software that’s used to run your site, not only the WordPress software, is not only up-to-date but kept up-to-date. We also cover home directory and webroot hygiene as well as disabling directory listing and error reporting. 
I then show how to set up and install the Wordfence Security plugin which will:
I demonstrate how to set up and schedule back-ups. So if anything goes wrong in the future you can restore your site back to an early copy. 
I then go on to explain step-by-step technical methods to really lock down a WordPress website.
Don’t think that online security doesn't matter to you. Your online security is as important as your physical security. 
My name's Rob Cubbon and I have run a web and graphic design business for over a decade. I have built countless WordPress websites for myself and others. 
However, I have been hacked!
This was a chastening experience. Not only was this attach to one of my websites extremely costly in terms of money and time, but I was also shocked at my ignorance of many website security procedures. 
Online security, website security, and WordPress security are now topics I take extremely seriously. I want to prevent other people from having a similarly terrible experience."

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. Any malicious activity or violation is typically reported either to an administrator or collected centrally using a security information and event management (SIEM) system.

We will use several MIT licensed Angular and Node packages from Auth0 (that you could use in your application), and we will also include a demo of how to use Auth0 for doing Application User Management.
Its important to realize that this is NOT an Auth0 specific course. Auth0 will be the source of a couple of open source packages we will use, and will be doing a quick demo of it to show how JWT makes it simple to delegate authentication to a third-party system, which could be developed in-house as well.
Security - A Fundamental Step in a Software Development Career
Security is probably the number one advanced topic that Software Developers are expected to master when going forward in their software development careers.
Security knowledge is hard to come by but its essential for advancing to more senior software development positions, like for example Application Architect or similar.
Learning Web Security Fundamentals, knowing how to design an application for security, and knowing how to recognize and fix security issues is an essential skill for a senior developer.
But the problem is that security knowledge is orthogonal to most other topics and it typically takes years to learn.
The good news is that once you have it, Security knowledge has a much longer shelf live than most software development knowledge in general.
Most of the vulnerabilities and fixes that you will learn in this course were useful 10 years ago, and will (very likely) still be useful 10 years from now - Angular and Node are just an example of one stack, to make the course examples more practical.
Security is seen as something really hard to master - this is actually not the case! Application Security is much more approachable than you might think, depending on how you learn it.
What Is The Best Way To Learn Security in a Fun and Practical Way?
Here is what we will do: we are going to take the skeleton of a running application that has no security yet, and we are going to secure the application step-by-step.
Using a couple of MIT packages from Auth0 (that you would be able to use in any project), we are going to implement the Sign-Up and Login functionality from scratch, and because security cannot be enforced only at the client-side, we will implement both the frontend in Angular and the backend in Node.
As we secure the application, and we are going to periodically attack the application many times during the course, to prove that the vulnerabilities are real!!
By doing so, we will learn along the way the fundamentals of Authentication and Authorization, we will become familiar with common vulnerabilities like Dictionary Attacks, CSRF and others, and we will get familiar with commonly used cryptographic tools like Hashing, Salting, JWT, password storage recommendations and more.
Please don't be intimidated by these concepts: The focus in this course will not be on the internals of each of the cryptographic tools that we will use, but instead on understanding on a high-level what problems do these tools solve, when to use each and why.
We will also learn how to design our application for security, and we will learn how in many situations application design is ou best defense.
Course Overview
We will start at the beginning: we will see the proper way of doing User Management and Sign Up: we will learn how to store passwords in a database, and we will introduce cryptographic hashes in an approachable way.
Once we have the Sign-Up functionality in place, we will implement Login and understand the need for a temporary identity token. Our first implementation will be stateful login, where the token is kept at the server level.
And at this point we could think we have authentication in place, but we decide to prepare our application for scalability, so we decide to try a JWT (JSON Web Tokens) based approach, because we know that this is what services like Firebase and Auth0 use.
We will use a couple of Auth0 packages to quickly refactor our Login to be JWT based, and learn the advantages of using JWT, and some potential disadvantages as well.
We will then see how its also possible to do Authentication using a third-party JWT-based service like Auth0, effectively removing all authentication logic from both our codebase and our database, and delegating it to a third-party service.
Note that this Auth0-specific part is only a small part of the course, and its main goal is to show how its possible at an enterprise level to delegate authentication to a centralized service, whithout having to introduce direct communication between applications and the centralized authentication service.
This means that if you can't use Auth0 at your company, you can apply the same design principles and design a JWT-solution that delegates authentication to a centralized server behind the firewall.
We will then cover how to do UI-level role-based functionality in Angular using the Angular Router, and a custom directive for showing or hiding certain parts of the UI depending on the role of the user. We will learn why the Router cannot enforce actual security.
We will also talk about server-side Authorization, and we will implement a commonly needed security-related Admin Level functionality: The Login As User service, that allows an admin to login as any user, to investigate a problem report. We can see why we would need to secure this functionality!
At the end of all these vulnerabilities and security fixes, we will have a well secured application and we will have learned a ton of security-related concepts along the way in a fun and practical way!
What Will you Learn In this Course?
With this course, you will have a rock-solid foundation on Web Application Security Fundamentals, and you will have gained the practical experience of applying those concepts by defending an application from a series of security attacks. You will have done so by actually performing many of the attacks!
You will have learned these concepts in the context of an Angular/Node application, but these concepts are applicable to any other technology stack.
You will learn what built-in mechanisms does Angular provide to defend against security problems, and what vulnerabilities it does NOT defend against and why.
You will be familiar with best practices for password storage, custom authentication service design and implementation, you will know the essentials about cryptographic hashes, be familiar with JWT and several commonly used open source Auth0 packages.
You will be familiar with the following security vulnerabilities: Dictionary attacks, identity token highjacking techniques, the browser same-origin policy, how to combine cookies with JWTs and why, Cross--Site Request Forgery or CSRF, common design vulnerabilities, and more.
You will know common practical solutions for securing both enterprise and public internet applications, such as how to use JWT to delegate authentication to a centralized service, which could be Auth0 or a in-house developed service that follows similar principles.
You will know how to implement UI-level authorization and use client-side constructs like Router guards to implement it and even build your own authorization-related UI directives.
You will also learn about server side authorization, and how to implement a commonly needed backend service that is only accessible to Admins - Login As User.
What Will You Be Able to do at the End Of This Course?
This course could help you take your development career to a more senior level, where the knowledge about web application security is essential and a key differentiating factor.
If you are a private internet business owner or thinking of launching your own platform, this course will contain most of what you need in practice to secure your own online platform in a robust and effective way.
With this course, you will have the knowledge necessary for evaluating many third-party security-related solutions, and you will know where to look for vulnerabilities in your application.
You will be able to understand most application-level vulnerability reports that come out of security audits done by third party companies, and you will be able to understand and fix the most commonly reported problems."

This course offers an introduction to API Security with OAuth 2.0. In 3 hours you will gain an overview of the capabilities of OAuth. You will learn the core concepts of OAuth. You will get to know all 4 OAuth flows that are used in cloud solutions and mobile apps.
If you have tried to read the official OAuth specification, you may get the impression that OAuth is complex. This course explains OAuth in simple terms. The four OAuth flows are visualized graphically using sequence diagrams. The diagrams are then animated so you get to know the interactions step by step and see the big picture of the various OAuth interactions. This high-level overview is complemented with rich set of example requests and responses and an explanation of the technical details.
Who should take this course?
You believe OAuth is complicated? OAuth may seem complex with flows and redirects going back and forth. This course will give you clarity by introducing the seemingly complicated material by many illustrations. These illustrations clearly show all the involved interaction parties and the messages they exchange.
You want to learn the OAuth concepts efficiently? This course uses many animated diagrams and sequence diagrams. A good diagram says more than 1000 words.
You want to use OAuth in your mobile app? If you want to access resources that are protected by OAuth, you need to get a token first, before you can access the resource. For this, you need to understand the OAuth flows and the dependencies between the steps of the flows.
You want to use OAuth to protect your APIs? OAuth is perfectly suited to protect your APIs. You can learn which OAuth endpoints need to be provided and which checks need to be made within the protected APIs."

These are the baseline modules from which all other modules in the Angular ecosystem are built with, so this is the part of Angular that you want to learn first, and in as much detail as possible.
In this course, you will get an exhaustive guided tour of all the functionality available in these two Angular essential modules (including Angular Elements).
This guide will cover everything from the most commonly used features of Angular, up until the most advanced topics of Angular Core, such as the multiple modes of change detection, style isolation, dependency injection, content projection, internationalization, and more.
The course starts from the beginning, assuming no prior knowledge of Angular. Each concept is introduced based only on previous concepts, so there are no forward references to help with the learning process. Even though the course starts with the essential concepts of Angular, it will quickly evolve into intermediate to advanced topics. So no matter what your current Angular level is, there is something for everyone in this course!   
Course Overview
This course will start with a quick and practical introduction to the Angular framework. You are going to set up your development environment, and using the Angular CLI you will quickly scaffold a small Angular project from scratch.
Using this initial playground, we are then going to answer some of the most common Angular questions: Why Angular, what are its main advantages and key features? We will answer this by demonstrating how the change detection mechanism works, and introduce some of the Angular template syntax.

Angular by itself is an amazing framework, that together with the Angular CLI makes our life as developers simpler than ever. But imagine what it would mean if adopting this new framework would mean also that we would have to write manually our own form controls as well: such as for example date pickers, dropdowns and other commonly needed widgets.
Developing solid form controls, containers, navigation menus and modal components on top of pure Angular still requires a lot of time and effort, especially if we are looking for a consistently themed component suite with commonly needed advanced features such as for example great ergonomics, design and user experience (including animations).
The good news is that we don't have to do that anymore because together with Angular we now have available an amazing suite of Material Design components, ready to be used! And that is what this course is all about: The Angular Material component suite.
Course Overview
We will start first by scaffolding an Angular Material application for scratch from an empty folder, add it a theme and gesture support. Next, we will start exploring the Angular Material components starting with some navigation menu and icons.
The goal here is to show that its also possible to use Angular Material components also in a more incremental way, by mixing Angular Material Components with a couple of custom-made components and just some HTML/CSS. Later in this section, we will use a more advanced menu system where Angular Material is essentially taking over the whole application layout, with a side menu component.
We are then going to introduce container components such as for example Tab Containers and Material Cards, and we will show a complete example of how to use a data table with a data source, pagination and sorting. We will also show how to use Modals to edit some of data in the data table, for which we will use multiple different types of form components to build an editable form: date pickers, slider, and more.
At the end of the course, we will show we can customize the look and feel of the Angular Material component suite, by building our own custom theme.
What Will You be able to do at the End Of This Course?
You will be able to comfortably build an Angular application using Angular Material and the Angular CLI. You will be able to scaffold an application from an empty folder, and have gestures and animations working out of the box.
You will be able to setup the navigation menu of the application using the Angular Router and different types of Angular Material menus. You will be able to setup the main layout of your application using standard Angular Material container components such as Tab Containers or Cards, and use common components such as: data tables, lists, date pickers, and all sorts of form controls.
You will be able to build your own Modal dialogs, setup a custom theme and much more, and you will be able to focus your development effort on building the application core functionality itself, instead of building the infrastructure-level UI widgets, the UI design and the enhanced user experience that we get immediately out of the box with Angular Material.

All the video content of this course is in line with the latest Angular 7 release.
If you are looking to learn quickly how to leverage the Angular router to build the navigation system of your application, then this is the right course for you! 
We will cover everything from basic scenarios like how to set up the router in your application, declarative and programmatic navigation, to common business scenarios like implementing a Master / Detail navigation, Auxiliary Routes, Router Guards and Router Lazy Loading. 
This course includes an exercise at the end where we will build a dashboard.  
Course Detailed Overview
Single Page Applications have been around for many years now, but as we surf the Internet we rarely find them today. Why ? The main reason for that has been the difficulty of having single page apps be properly ranked by search engines.
But there are some very good news for Angular Developers, and developers of single page apps in general: the Google crawler is now much better at crawling single page applications, meaning that today its more important than ever for a developer to be able to build such type of applications. Also Single Page apps are and will likely continue to be very popular for building authenticated dashboards and enterprise applications.
The bottom line is that In the upcoming years we can expect an increase in the number of single page applications, so the goal of this course is to prepare you for that scenario by doing a step by step deep dive into the Angular Router.
What You Will Learn
This course covers the Angular Router in-depth. Its a continuously evolving course so you can expect new sections to be added as new releases are made. We are going to cover all the major routing concepts, starting at the beginning.
First we will cover how can we setup the router and avoid right off the bat some very common pitfalls that happen to developers that are just trying out the router for the first time. We are going to learn both declarative template driven routing and imperative or programmatic routing, and we are going to cover in detail child routes: when to use them and why, how do they work.
We are going to cover how the Angular Router allows us to easily implement some commonly used patterns like Master Detail. We are going to learn about the reactive features of the routers, namely we will cover the multiple parameters and query parameters observables.
We will cover the notion of route snapshot and we are going to show how routing can be the source of accidental memory leaks and how we can prevent that. The course will also cover route guards and auxiliary routes: we are going to learn exactly what are auxiliary routes but more importantly we will cover when should we use them, why and what are some common use cases.
The course finishes off with a very cool exercise where we are going to learn how we can build a widget dashboard by using the notion of auxiliary routes. With this course you can expect to get a solid foundation on the Angular router and feel confident tackling real world applications scenarios that involve the Angular Router."

Why Does Angular Need a Forms Module ?
HTML Forms seem deceivingly simple. Yet Angular Forms is one of the main core modules of the framework, and its very powerful. Why do we need a full framework module to implement something so simple as forms ? The answer is simple: forms can be some of the most complex user interfaces that a developer might have to implement.
There are simple forms of course, like for example a login and password form. But very quickly and especially in the case of dashboard development, enterprise applications, and CRUD applications we can have use cases where some very complex forms need to be implemented, spanning multiple tabs and with dialogs that edit parts of the form, all coupled with complex business logic validation rules.
Keeping track of which parts of a large form are valid and displaying to the user relevant form error messages at the right time while keeping a good user experience is a non-trivial task, that can benefit a lot from the help of a framework.
What You will Learn In This Course
In this Angular Forms tutorial you will learn how to implement both simple and complex forms in Angular, by using two different form building mechanisms: Template Driven and Reactive Forms. You will learn how to use each separately by using them to build the same form.
You will learn when to use each form type and why. You will also learn how form development can benefit tremendously from using functional reactive programming techniques, and how Angular model driven forms make that easier than ever. You will learn how the reactive forms API exposes RxJs Observables that can be leveraged to implement these functional reactive techniques.
In the end we are going to tie everything together with an exercise: we are going to build step by step a signup form which will include multi-field validation.

This course covers Angular 6 and all the server code is in Typescript, but the security concepts explained in it are applicable to other technology stacks.
This course uses the Typescript language, and includes an auxiliary Ebook - The Typescript Jumpstart Ebook
We will use several MIT licensed Angular and Node packages from Auth0 (that you could use in your application), and we will also include a demo of how to use Auth0 for doing Application User Management.
Its important to realize that this is NOT an Auth0 specific course. Auth0 will be the source of a couple of open source packages we will use, and will be doing a quick demo of it to show how JWT makes it simple to delegate authentication to a third-party system, which could be developed in-house as well.
Security - A Fundamental Step in a Software Development Career
Security is probably the number one advanced topic that Software Developers are expected to master when going forward in their software development careers.
Security knowledge is hard to come by but its essential for advancing to more senior software development positions, like for example Application Architect or similar.
Learning Web Security Fundamentals, knowing how to design an application for security, and knowing how to recognize and fix security issues is an essential skill for a senior developer.
But the problem is that security knowledge is orthogonal to most other topics and it typically takes years to learn.
The good news is that once you have it, Security knowledge has a much longer shelf live than most software development knowledge in general.
Most of the vulnerabilities and fixes that you will learn in this course were useful 10 years ago, and will (very likely) still be useful 10 years from now - Angular and Node are just an example of one stack, to make the course examples more practical.
Security is seen as something really hard to master - this is actually not the case! Application Security is much more approachable than you might think, depending on how you learn it.
What Is The Best Way To Learn Security in a Fun and Practical Way?
Here is what we will do: we are going to take the skeleton of a running application that has no security yet, and we are going to secure the application step-by-step.
Using a couple of MIT packages from Auth0 (that you would be able to use in any project), we are going to implement the Sign-Up and Login functionality from scratch, and because security cannot be enforced only at the client-side, we will implement both the frontend in Angular and the backend in Node.
As we secure the application, and we are going to periodically attack the application many times during the course, to prove that the vulnerabilities are real!!
By doing so, we will learn along the way the fundamentals of Authentication and Authorization, we will become familiar with common vulnerabilities like Dictionary Attacks, CSRF and others, and we will get familiar with commonly used cryptographic tools like Hashing, Salting, JWT, password storage recommendations and more.
Please don't be intimidated by these concepts: The focus in this course will not be on the internals of each of the cryptographic tools that we will use, but instead on understanding on a high-level what problems do these tools solve, when to use each and why.
We will also learn how to design our application for security, and we will learn how in many situations application design is ou best defense.

We will start at the beginning: we will see the proper way of doing User Management and Sign Up: we will learn how to store passwords in a database, and we will introduce cryptographic hashes in an approachable way.
Once we have the Sign-Up functionality in place, we will implement Login and understand the need for a temporary identity token. Our first implementation will be stateful login, where the token is kept at the server level.
And at this point we could think we have authentication in place, but we decide to prepare our application for scalability, so we decide to try a JWT (JSON Web Tokens) based approach, because we know that this is what services like Firebase and Auth0 use.
We will use a couple of Auth0 packages to quickly refactor our Login to be JWT based, and learn the advantages of using JWT, and some potential disadvantages as well.
We will then see how its also possible to do Authentication using a third-party JWT-based service like Auth0, effectively removing all authentication logic from both our codebase and our database, and delegating it to a third-party service.
Note that this Auth0-specific part is only a small part of the course, and its main goal is to show how its possible at an enterprise level to delegate authentication to a centralized service, whithout having to introduce direct communication between applications and the centralized authentication service.
This means that if you can't use Auth0 at your company, you can apply the same design principles and design a JWT-solution that delegates authentication to a centralized server behind the firewall.
We will then cover how to do UI-level role-based functionality in Angular using the Angular Router, and a custom directive for showing or hiding certain parts of the UI depending on the role of the user. We will learn why the Router cannot enforce actual security.
We will also talk about server-side Authorization, and we will implement a commonly needed security-related Admin Level functionality: The Login As User service, that allows an admin to login as any user, to investigate a problem report. We can see why we would need to secure this functionality!
At the end of all these vulnerabilities and security fixes, we will have a well secured application and we will have learned a ton of security-related concepts along the way in a fun and practical way!
What Will you Learn In this Course?
With this course, you will have a rock-solid foundation on Web Application Security Fundamentals, and you will have gained the practical experience of applying those concepts by defending an application from a series of security attacks. You will have done so by actually performing many of the attacks!
You will have learned these concepts in the context of an Angular/Node application, but these concepts are applicable to any other technology stack.
You will learn what built-in mechanisms does Angular provide to defend against security problems, and what vulnerabilities it does NOT defend against and why.
You will be familiar with best practices for password storage, custom authentication service design and implementation, you will know the essentials about cryptographic hashes, be familiar with JWT and several commonly used open source Auth0 packages.
You will be familiar with the following security vulnerabilities: Dictionary attacks, identity token highjacking techniques, the browser same-origin policy, how to combine cookies with JWTs and why, Cross--Site Request Forgery or CSRF, common design vulnerabilities, and more.
You will know common practical solutions for securing both enterprise and public internet applications, such as how to use JWT to delegate authentication to a centralized service, which could be Auth0 or a in-house developed service that follows similar principles.
You will know how to implement UI-level authorization and use client-side constructs like Router guards to implement it and even build your own authorization-related UI directives.
You will also learn about server side authorization, and how to implement a commonly needed backend service that is only accessible to Admins - Login As User.
What Will You Be Able to do at the End Of This Course?
This course could help you take your development career to a more senior level, where the knowledge about web application security is essential and a key differentiating factor.
If you are a private internet business owner or thinking of launching your own platform, this course will contain most of what you need in practice to secure your own online platform in a robust and effective way.
With this course, you will have the knowledge necessary for evaluating many third-party security-related solutions, and you will know where to look for vulnerabilities in your application.
You will be able to understand most application-level vulnerability reports that come out of security audits done by third party companies, and you will be able to understand and fix the most commonly reported problems."

The goal of this course is to give you all the tools necessary for you to be able to do your own open source Angular Library.
We will build a series of small open source libraries of progressively increasing difficulty, and we will learn a large number of Angular advanced features in a very fun and practical way.
What Is The Best Way To Learn Advanced Angular Features?The best way to learn Angular and its most advanced features is to simply take and use it to build something very concrete, like for example an application or a library - and do it in a step-by-step way, as there is no replacement for that experience.
In order to understand a technology, we really need to build something non-trivial with it - blog posts and docs will only get us so far.
This is of course very time-consuming to do without any help because we will have to learn everything by ourselves along the way as we build something, gluing together an endless number of blog posts, documentation and Stackoverflow answers.
So because of this, in order to really dive deep into Angular we will be using it to build a series of small reusable libraries. The goal is to create a practice scenario, and learn the advanced features of Angular in their original use cases, where they make the most sense and so are easier to learn.
What Libraries Will We Build In This Course?We will be building the following libraries, and learn how to publish them on NPM using the Angular Package Format: We will start by doing a Font Awesome customizable Input Box and learn the advantages of designing our components using content projection over a more input/output based design. At this stage we will also introduce the Angular Testing ecosystem.
Then we will progressively increase the difficulty of each library: we will build a dynamic tab container that allows to receive a template as a component input, effectively allowing to override parts of the component template while keeping a default look and feel for the component.
We will then build a reusable dynamic modal component with customizable content. This component have its contents configurable via either content projection or an input template, and will introduce the notion of Structural Directives.
We will also learn how directives and components of a given module can interact in a transparent way, independently of the place where they are used in the template, using a shared library service. We will then build a Input mask directive, where we will cover some advanced keyboard handling behavior.
At the end of the course, we are going to take all the components and directives that we built in previous sections, and we are going to build one larger example using them: A Payment Modal Widget!
We will then introduce the Angular Animations module, and use it to animate the modal widget, we will see how to define animations that can be reused across components.
What Will you Learn In this Course?We will learn how to create an AOT compatible library in the Angular Package Format, how to define a library module, how to isolate the styles of a component but still make them customizable, how to design components and directives to make them easier to maintain - making them customizable while at the same time giving the components great default behavior.
We will cover all of the more advanced features of Angular, including Component API Design, Component Styling best practices, Templates and Template Outlets, ng-content, ng-container, style isolation and customization, AOT, global events, debugging with the CLI, @ViewChildren, @ContentChildren, Light DOM vs Shadow DOM, @HostBinding, @HostListener, dynamic components, directives, handling keyboard events, testing, animations and more (this is a non-extensive list).
But more than presenting the features in isolation, we will use them in real use cases which will make the features much easier to learn.
What Will You Be Able to do at the End Of This Course?By the end of this course you will know many of the most advanced features of Angular, but most of all you will know when to use them and why. You will know how to build open source Angular libraries, and know how to make them available to the open source community on NPM.
With this advanced course, you will have a rock-solid foundation on Angular: you will very likely be able to tackle the more advanced Angular development tasks that you will come across in your day to day job or personal projects.

If you already know Angular, and would now like to dive deeper into the Angular ecosystem and learn Angular Server-Side Rendering, then this is the right course for you!
This course uses the Typescript language, and includes an auxiliary Ebook - The Typescript Jumpstart Ebook
In this course we are going to learn Angular Universal from first principles, by taking an existing Angular single page application and converting it into an Angular Universal Application.
We will learn how to optimize our application for initial startup performance by using a fine-grained Application Shell and the State Transfer API, and we will make the application SEO (search engine optimization) and social-media friendly.
We will then deploy it to production using Firebase Cloud Functions and Firebase Hosting and see the end result!
Course Overview
We will kick-start this course by going over in detail on the advantages of using Angular Universal in our application.
After this, we will go ahead and take an existing Angular Application and using the Angular CLI we will generate an Universal bundle that will allow us to render the application on the server side.
With the Universal bundle in place, we will introduce universal rendering by writing a command line utility that will pre-render only our application root route into plain HTML.
With this in place, we will go ahead and start writing our own Angular Universal Express Server from scratch, from first principles. This option will allow us to understand in detail how universal rendering works, and it will give us a lot of flexibility.
But if we want a ready to use Express server, we can also use @nguniversal, which we will also cover. Once we have our Angular Express application up and running, we will then make it SEO and social-media friendly.
We will then apply a couple of common performance optimizations that are commonly used in Angular Universal applications: we will implement from scratch a fine-grained Application shell, and we will also reduce the number of HTTP requests that the application does at startup time by using the State Transfer API.
We will then take our fully optimized Angular Universal application and we will deploy it in production using the Firebase ecosystem: we will host the static bundle files using Firebase Hosting, and we will deploy our universal server as a Firebase Cloud Function.
What Will you Learn In this Course?
At the end of this course, you will feel comfortable taking your existing Angular Application and turning it into a server side Angular Universal application.
You will understand the benefits of server-side rendering, and you will be able to optimize your application for both search engines and social media crawlers.
You will also know how to further optimize your universal application for performance, and you will know how to deploy it to production.

What is Your Biggest Difficulty While Learning Angular ?
RxJS and Reactive Programming can sometimes be seen as hard to get into. Although RxJs is optional in many parts of the Angular API and we can usually use Promises instead, one of the items of the Angular Project Roadmap is to allow to build reactive style applications, so clearly reactive programming is a topic that is close to the framework.
What is The Best Way To Learn RxJs ?
Why is RxJs and Reactive Programming sometimes seen as hard to get into ? The main reason for that could be that Observables and reactive programming are often presented as either a programming paradigm shift, an alternative to Promises or a generalization of functions, which are approaches that don't help as much as we could think in the learning process.
We are going to take an alternative way for learning these concepts: we are going to see that RxJs and Observables are actually a very practical and effective solution to a very common set of problems that we face all the time while building asynchronous programs like user interfaces.
We are going to see that everything around RxJs and Reactive Programming revolves around one fundamental notion: The Observable Pattern.
The Best Way To Learn RxJs
We are going to approach reactive programming as a set of application development patterns, that are an evolution of previously existing solutions. So in the first section of the course we will cover the Observable pattern as a design solution for building asynchronous applications that scale well in complexity.
We are going to cover the multiple other satellite concepts around the Observable pattern, namely the Observer and the Subject, and we are also going to learn the benefits of writing applications in Reactive style by implementing our own simplified version of an event bus.
We are then going to see why that does not scale well in complexity, after that we will refactor the application into using the Observable pattern and see how it elegantly solves many of the problems of the initial implementation.
We will also introduce the Store Pattern, see how it relates to the Observable Pattern. At the of this section we will then introduce the RxJs library, which at this point will make a lot more sense given the previous presentation of the design patterns that its based upon.
What Patterns will be covered in this course ?
With the Observable pattern and its related concepts in place and having introduced the RxJs Library, we are going to see how it can be used to build Angular Applications in Reactive Style.
We are going to cover a set of reactive patterns for both the View Layer and the Service layer, by using a set of small applications with a ready to use backend built in either Firebase or a local HTTP server. The patterns will be introduced as either implementations from scratch of a given functionality, or via step-by-step refactorings.
The pattern catalog of the second part of the course will include: Stateless Observable Services, Smart vs Presentational Components, Observable Data Services, Nested Subscribe Anti-Pattern, Data Table Pagination, Local Services, Master Detail With Cached Master Table, Error Handling Components and Services, Router Data Pre-Fetching (with Loading Indicator), Container Components, Reactive Forms Draft Pre-Save.
This section also includes a couple of related discussions concerning application design, like how to avoid Event Bubbling over the local presentational component tree, and how to use deeply nested smart components with OnPush change detection.
What Will You Be Able To Do After Taking This Course ?
After taking this course you will be comfortable with Reactive Programming, the Observable Pattern and the RxJs library.
You will be able to reason much more easily about RxJs because you now know the fundamental concepts that it bases itself upon, as well as the design intentions behind it. You will be able to find your way around the documentation and know several commonly used operators. Most of all you know how to build Angular applications in Reactive Style using the RxJs library."

Script for Angular/JS
Angular JavaScript, commonly styled as AngularJS, is basically another JavaScript framework like React, Ember, and jQuery (mostly considered as a library). A Google employee, Misko Hevery, created and developed this framework. Compared to other JS frameworks, AngularJS is supported by Google. 

  
For the uninitiated, frameworks like Angular add more functionality to JavaScript and HTML. Their primary purpose is to make it easier for people to create scripts and robust web pages. In addition, they reduce the lines of codes you need to write in order to achieve a certain goal.

  
To take advantage of Angular JS, you just need to include it in your page and use its numerous modules, expressions, filters, directives, and controller. To learn how to use them, you must have knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

  
Why Should You Take This Course?
First, if you are taking web development as a career, it is a must that you know two or three JavaScript frameworks. Also, take note that the three most common frameworks required by employer nowadays are jQuery, React, and Angular.

  
Second, Angular is fully backed by Google. You can expect that it will be continually developed and used for a long time. And that guarantees that the demand for people who know Angular will be always be high. Learning it will be a good investment of your time.

  
Third, it is also useful in creating apps, Single Page Applications or SPAs to be precise. The Web has become a huge platform for creating and using programs. The Internet is not only used for browsing information anymore, but it has become a place where things, primarily computing, can be done, too.

  
Fourth, MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js) stack is getting too popular. For you to become a very competitive developer, you do not need to get stuck only knowing the common stacks like LAMP and WAMP. 

  
Fifth, it is just too easy to learn as long as you have a decent background in HTML and JavaScript. To be frank, learning Angular is just like learning HTML5. You will be mostly adding new “attributes” in your HTML arsenal — of course, Angular is not limited to that.

  
The Advantages of Angular JS
As mentioned, one of the biggest strengths of Angular JS is the creation of Single Page Applications. Frameworks like Angular make it easier and faster to develop an application or scripts. You do not need to start from scratch. All the common functions and modules are already made for you, and all you need to do is integrate it in your code.

  
Another strength of Angular is the ease of modular development. Angular provides a better implementation when it comes to modules. If you have code that you will use over and over again, you can just turn it into a module and just call it whenever you want.

  
Code made in Angular JS is more readable, organized, and structured. If you are going to work with a team, those traits will make the work easier for you and your coworkers.

The main goal this course is trying to accomplish is to save you time, because learning the basics of any framework, can take lots of time and at certain point most of the people give up. The lectures are structured using Angular version 6, this way you can learn to use the latest platform changes. The code is full of explanations on each and every step, leaving you not wandering on how and why the things happen.
What to expect to learn how to :
structure an Angular application using best practices
create, use and style components, services and work with templates
build image upload service with the help of NodeJS and express
use the Visual Studio code
We will develop 2 projects: 
click button component
profiles with image upload functionality
The course is also good to quickly compare if you would like to continue working with the Angular or switch to another framework. After you finish with the course, you can browse for other courses, in order to expand your knowledge.
The course starts with installation of the Angular platform using NodeJS, setting up environment using Visual Studio Code and its TypeScript specific plugins. 
Our first project is just for warm up to get you comfortable using Angular with TypeScript. Then with the help of node package manager will install JSON server for storing user textual data, and express server for the image upload data. You will be able to learn how to configure them both. During the course we will be using Angular command line interface (CLI) to easily create components and services. We will also take a look on how to use routing to load up specific components and make server queries based on route parameters. Later we will reveal a way to pass through the cross-origin browser CORS restrictions and be able to run Angular application and servers on same development machine. 
Wishing you happy learning !"

Adding fitting styles and animations to a web page tremendously improves the user experience!
It's more than a little bonus - animations and styles help the user understand the flow of your page, pass on feedback to the user and overall improve the usability of your page.
This course teaches you which tools Angular gives you to dynamically style and animate your web page. This is not a CSS basics course - this course will really dive into the rich toolset Angular ships with, allowing you to build a reactive, user-friendly web application.
Just think about your favorite web apps: How many of these look ugly, seem to be styled randomly (and statically) and use no animations? Probably not that many - time to join the club of developers creating awesome user experiences!

That's how this course is built, with the goal to help you both learn and understand AngularJS.  
 Note: In this course you'll also get downloadable source code. You will often be provided with 'starter' code, giving you the base for you to start writing your code, and 'finished' code to compare your code to."

Absolutely fantastic tutorial series. I cannot thank you enough. The quality is first class and your presentational skills are second to none. Keep up this excellent work. You really rock!﻿ - Paul Whitehouse
The instructor, Max, is very enthusiastic and engaging. He does a great job of explaining what he's doing and why rather than having students just mimic his coding. Max was also very responsive to questions. I would recommend this course and any others that he offers. Thanks, Max!
As a person new to both JavaScript and Angular 2 I found this course extremely helpful because Max does a great job of explaining all the important concepts behind the code. Max has a great teaching ability to focus on what his audience needs to understand.
This Course uses TypeScript
TypeScript is the main language used by the official Angular team and the language you'll mostly see in Angular tutorials. It's a superset to JavaScript and makes writing Angular apps really easy. Using it ensures, that you will have the best possible preparation for creating Angular apps. Check out the free videos for more information.
TypeScript knowledge is, however, not required - basic JavaScript knowledge is enough.
Why Angular?
Angular is the next big deal. Being the successor of the overwhelmingly successful Angular.js framework it’s bound to shape the future of frontend development in a similar way. The powerful features and capabilities of Angular allow you to create complex, customizable, modern, responsive and user friendly web applications.
Angular 7 simply is the latest version of the Angular framework and simply an update to Angular 2.
Angular is faster than Angular 1 and offers a much more flexible and modular development approach. After taking this course you’ll be able to fully take advantage of all those features and start developing awesome applications immediately.
Due to the drastic differences between Angular 1 and Angular (=Angular 7) you don’t need to know anything about Angular.js to be able to benefit from this course and build your futures projects with Angular.
Get a very deep understanding of how to create Angular applications
This course will teach you all the fundamentals about modules, directives, components, databinding, routing, HTTP access and much more!

In this update we addressed the major changes in the Angular version 7.1.1 release (late November 2018).  Per our course content, including hands-on coding exercises, there were a few breaking changes in the 7.0.x releases which ripped across much of the original project code and also included minor, non-breaking changes which outdated certain aspects of our original content.    

We updated all of the course’s code-along video content to fix the breaking changes, including:
Angular-CLI & npm syntax usage
Angular-CLI template output changes
Material 2 inclusion and configuration syntax changes

Fallout of the above deltas outdated a large percentage of the course’s existing content.  Each affected video in the series was updated to reflect the current release.

The Angular CLI has been continually improving since its inception.  Additional features that have bumped its power up changed some of the commands and flags that are used in creating new Angular projects, generating assets, and adding schematics.  

While closely tied to the Angular core library, but not included in it, the Material 2 styling library has endured a lengthy, rough development and release lifecycle.  As this library is so closely tied to the Angular core, we’ve included content in this video series from the beginning.  Again, in this current release, many breaking changes and previously unavailable features were included.  We made significant changes to existing content and created additional content to appropriately cover the current state of the Material library.

As with prior updates to this video series, we applied incremental improvements  to existing content in an effort to continuously improve the overall effectiveness and appeal of the entire course. 

Keeping Current with Angular
This course will be updated regularly to reflect the constant changes in the Angular framework. We're teaching this course in a modular style rather than project-based style so that small changes in Angular can be updated right away, and not affect your ability to learn in any way.

A big part of the problem is a lack of resources and limited understanding of how to integrate these 2 awesome technologies, Angular on the front-end and ASP.Net Core on the back-end.
The big problem, is that the industry has always tried to simplify the solution by compartmentalizing the technologies. But knowing how to integrate technologies is the key to performance, and making an application easy to maintain. This mean you must have a good understanding of the backend technologies, the development environment, as well as the frontend technologies.
Why do you think Microsoft seems behind in the integration of Angular on the front-end? Hmm… Could it be that the newer technologies have us dropping down to the command line? Why do we need to drop down to the command line anyway? Could it be the only way to be compatible across multiple platforms? Are there Microsoft developers that like to drop down to the command line? Can I do my complete development, without dropping down to the command line? Watch this course, and I will show you how!"

Mosh has a fantastic teaching style, and just delivered the best online course I've seen in a long time. Mosh's approach to teaching and guiding makes no assumptions on existing Angular 1.x knowledge, but helps those who have to clarify new concepts. Mosh guides you through critical concepts slowly without skipping over details, and the course is extremely worth investing a few hours in, your understanding of Angular 2 will reach new levels. He fills all the gaps, presents impeccably well and the preparation was top notch, seriously can't recommend the course enough.

I’m a certified Scrum trainer and Agile coach. I do public training, such as the certified scrum master and the certified product owner class, as well as private trainings in companies across the nation.  
  	In this class, I will give you and your team enough information to baseline everyone, and let you get going with Scrum and Agile: what it means to be Agile, what Scrum is and how it is Agile, the roles and the meetings in Scrum, and the underpinnings and requirements of Scrum.  
  	In the class videos, I try to incorporate my usual engaging style with lots of examples and stories. We’ve created an accompanying .pdf handout to give you some walk away notes and resources to dive in deeper on the points that interest you in particular. This video could be used with teams or management to help get everyone on the same page about what it means to be Agile and implement Scrum.  
  	Students will fill in blanks and diagrams on the handout as they follow along with the videos. Students will complete several application exercises throughout the course. The video run time is a little over an hour... about 70 minutes. If students do all the exercises, they should be able to finish in less than 2 hours.  
  	We're going to cover all this and more in a one hour baseline overview that I hope is something that gives you a good sense of what Agile is, what it means to be Agile, and how we do Scrum. This course is not just for individuals, but hopefully for teams as well, to iron out some of the problems that they might face going forward.

In today’s world, you and your organization must be responsive, flexible, and make things happen quickly. You must do more with less – and faster. You no longer have business as usual, so why do business analysis as usual?
 
With the widespread adoption of Agile, software development has gone through some serious remodeling. Agile teams build robust products incrementally and iteratively, requiring fast feedback from the business community to define ongoing work.  As a result, the process of defining IT requirements is evolving rapidly. Backlogs replace requirements definition documents. User Stories, Epics and Features replace requirement statements. Scenarios and Examples replace test cases. The timing of business analysis activities is shifting like sand.
 
This course is a brief overview of how you can reduce waste in Business Analysis practices to optimally support the new lean and agile software development world. You will learn about topics such as:
·         The purpose of a product roadmap and a prioritized product backlog
·         The concept of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
·         Agile and Lean thinking applied to requirements discovery, analysis, and acceptance testing
·         Lean requirement constructs such as Features, User Stories, Epics, Scenarios, Examples, etc.

This course touches on the foundation principles and features of Unity. The course has been tested and is fully compatible with Unity 5.6, 2017.4 and 2018.1.
In Tier 1, we’re going to touch on Unity’s programming fundamentals to quickly deliver a prototype. For that, we’re going to be developing a 2D space shooter. All the sprites, the sounds and other assets are provided, so that we can focus on programming.
This training is for anyone who wants to learn object oriented programming for video games. It has introduction chapters that people familiar with Unity can skip. All the programming basics are covered, and we touch on all major features of Unity. The training focuses on programming, and uses a 2D game project to keep things simple and stay away from fancy graphics features that already are well documented. Whether you know programming or not, whether you're new to Unity or already have some experience, this training will give you the good practices and help you organise yourself in the chaos of a video game project.
I'm a self-taught developer myself. I work with Unity since 2011, and was very lucky to meet with mentors who taught me a great deal about Object Oriented Programming. That's a lot to learn about when your background is not in engineering, though, I figured that if I could do it, anyone can.I started to put this training course together a while back for a Master Class held with Unity, and decided to take it way beyond that, as I realised many developers were self-taught programmers, ex artist or designer, looking for that true programming knowledge.
I wanted to emphasise on Agile practices, while this is not an Agile training in itself, because of the huge demand for Agile programmers. Agile Development really is a mindset that you cannot push. From a programmer’s perspective, it’s mostly about letting go of your desire for completeness and architecture awesomeness, and willing to deliver playable software as early as possible. The responsibility given to programmers brings a lot of stress, with which comes the need to foresee, plan and control development. Then any change in the plan becomes a trouble.Team confidence is key to Agile Development, and confidence comes with knowledge.The more you know, the more you trust yourself, and the less you doubt.The less you fear change, the less complex and overthought you need to make your code, and the sooner you deliver a prototype.This training aims at empowering programmers with enough knowledge to be confident in their capability to react to design changes and always deliver the most business value in the time they’re given.Now, Agile Development isn’t just about prototyping, and we’ll also touch on Performances, Scalability and Reusability of the code, which is also key to maintain a project.
I really wanted this training to go beyond the usual academic training course. It does have a good share of theory, but everything is put into practice. Its course is well planned and offers a smooth learning curve, while its delivery is more like a live coding session in which I share what comes to my mind as to why I do things along with tips and tricks."

In Tier 1, we touched on Unity’s programming fundamentals to quickly deliver a prototype.
Tier 1 Complete Project is included so that you can jump right in!
In this second Tier will touch on Performances, Debugging, Design Patterns and other enhancements required to turn the prototype into a release.
This training is for anyone who wants to learn object oriented programming for video games. It has introduction chapters that people familiar with Unity can skip. All the programming basics are covered, and we touch on all major features of Unity. The training focuses on programming, and uses a 2D game project to keep things simple and stay away from fancy graphics features that already are well documented. Whether you know programming or not, whether you're new to Unity or already have some experience, this training will give you the good practices and help you organise yourself in the chaos of a video game project.

I'm a self-taught developer myself. I work with Unity since 2011, and was very lucky to meet with mentors who taught me a great deal about Object Oriented Programming. That's a lot to learn about when your background is not in engineering, though, I figured that if I could do it, anyone can.
I started to put this training course together a while back for a Master Class held with Unity, and decided to take it way beyond that, as I realised many developers were self-taught programmers, ex artist or designer, looking for that true programming knowledge.

I wanted to emphasise on Agile practices, while this is not an Agile training in itself, because of the huge demand for Agile programmers. Agile Development really is a mindset that you cannot push. From a programmer’s perspective, it’s mostly about letting go of your desire for completeness and architecture awesomeness, and willing to deliver playable software as early as possible. The responsibility given to programmers brings a lot of stress, with which comes the need to foresee, plan and control development. Then any change in the plan becomes a trouble.
Team confidence is key to Agile Development, and confidence comes with knowledge.
The more you know, the more you trust yourself, and the less you doubt.
The less you fear change, the less complex and overthought you need to make your code, and the sooner you deliver a prototype.
This training aims at empowering programmers with enough knowledge to be confident in their capability to react to design changes and always deliver the most business value in the time they’re given.
Now, Agile Development isn’t just about prototyping, and we’ll also touch on Performances, Scalability and Reusability of the code, which is also key to maintain a project.

I really wanted this training to go beyond the usual academic training course. It does have a good share of theory, but everything is put into practice. Its course is well planned and offers a smooth learning curve, while its delivery is more like a live coding session in which I share what comes to my mind as to why I do things along with tips and tricks."

With six hours of content, we'll focus on the three main types of users in Jira. The modules in this course are broken up for each of these types, so no matter which one you are you'll be able to quickly access the things you need.
We'll start by covering some core concepts and terms you'll need to know about both agile and Jira before diving into the software itself. 
After that, we'll look at Jira from an end user's perspective. What are the key things you'll need to know as someone who's just using Jira at your company? That's what we'll look at in the second module.
When you're a team leader or manager using Jira, there's some things you can do to help your team be more effective. So we'll look at some of these things in the third module.
Finally, as a Jira administrator there's a lot of ways you can help your company by setting them up for success in Jira. In the fourth module, we'll look at Jira from an administrator's perspective.
Now even though this course is organized for different types of users, I wanted to make it so no matter what type of user you are you'll benefit from watching all of it if you wanted. For example, even if you're only using Jira as an end user you can find it beneficial to understand how Jira workflows and processes work so you can ""speak the language"" when you're asking your Jira administrator for something."

BOTTOM LINE:
Bottom line is that I wanted to make sure this course as a comprehensive guide to Jira that anyone would need to either get introduced to Jira or get fully up to speed with the basic concepts and features. I feel the best way of learning something is by example. And so I put in over 11 hours of content explaining the features and concepts with examples and am continuously working on adding more examples and scenarios to share my experience and knowledge in using Jira within the real world. 
I'll be here to help answer any questions you might have along the way."

""Good overview of Scrum
A nice overview of Scrum process described in this course. I enjoyed going through it.""
""Really intuitive and an easy get to grips with course if you want or need an introduction into Scrum Methodology and Agile Development, this is for you. The instructor expertly breaks down the principles behind the introduction, into 21 very easy to follow steps. This course comes very highly recommended!!""
These are just a couple of the great reviews this course has received.
Scrum is a management and control process that focuses on building the software and meeting business needs; it is designed to cut through all the complexity. Project management and teams; using Scrum; are able to deliver working software incrementally using the requirements rather than spending a big percentage of time up front on understanding and planning all requirements before starting on the programming.
Scrum allows your analysts to create user stories from the requirements that will concentrate on what you need for the next iterations; this allows development to start at the beginning of the project. It also allows any changes in the requirements or scope to be addressed immediately rather than at the end of the development (as would happen in waterfall).
Scrum itself is a simple framework for effective team collaboration on complex projects.
This course has been designed to introduce you to Scrum, the elements of Scrum. You will learn what are the different roles in the Scrum Teams; you will learn about Scrum Artifacts (such as what is the Product Backlog) and you will learn about Scrum Reports.
I'm created this course so that anyone can get to grips with the Scrum process. By the end of this course you will have an understanding of the Scrum process and what you need to accomplish.
12th March 2015 - I've just added a new lecture on Retrospective Planning Resources. In this lecture I talk a little more about Retrospectives and give you a great resource to use when planning yours."

Special webinars will be conducted for participants who register for the CP-SAT Exam. If you wish to register for exam please mail to cpsatsupport@ataevents.org or visit www.agiletestingalliance.org,"What is CP-SAT?


CP-SAT stands for “Certified Professional – Selenium Automation Testing” certification prepared and honored by “Agile Testing Alliance” & “University Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)”. CP-SAT is the only global accepted certification exam which has practical assessment. 

Having basic knowledge of Java Programming and Manual Testing is the only prerequisite for this training.
The course is applicable for all roles and not just “testers”. Knowledge, experience & certification is consciously designed to focus on “agile testing” and not on “agile testers”.

The course covers IDE (older IDE), this was also a part of the syllabus earlier. Now it is not. You can directly start from the WebDriver section if you want to skip this entirely.
RC is also for older versions of Selenium and may be relevant to those who are still maintaining legacy scripts and are still using RC. This is also not part of the latest CP-SAT syllabus.

How is it useful?      
CP-SAT is designed to train agile professionals with the basics of testing web applications using Selenium leading to advanced topics. You can build, enhance, and maintain scripts in the Eclipse IDE Editor and port Selenese scripts to execution in RC and Selenium 2.x (WebDriver). The training is combination of theory as well as hands-on execution of scripts using the features of Selenium with ample time given to practice until you have mastered the concepts. The Selenium IDE plug-in builds effective and resilient test scripts using a wide variety of current programming languages. The focus is on the practical application of Selenium to resolve common web automated testing challenges. This course focuses on Selenium IDE with RC/Selenium 2.x configuration and execution related concepts using JUnit and TestNG. There is an extensive coverage on Selenium Reporting mechanism, Data Driven Testing, getting started Grid concepts, Continuous Integration (CI) with Jenkins/Ant.

Am I Eligible?      
Anyone having basic experience Java programming and manual testing can go for this certification.

Dave will teach you the theory and then put the theory into practice when building the CMS.
You will also learn how to style your site using Bootstrap, how to integrate third-party code into your site, how to store data in a relational database and use this from PHP code, and more.
The course is very thorough, and goes through everything from installing a web server on your own computer, and editor to writing the code to create your web app.  Towards the end of the course you will even learn how to upload the code and make your code live on the internet (very useful if you already have your own Hosting account).  This is not necessary to complete the course though.
In summary, the course will teach you the core skills you need to know to become a productive PHP programmer.
Why this course?
Firstly, Dave has been creating web applications since 1999, when he created his first web application for a major insurance company.  In addition he has been teaching IT for many years.

Are you new to web development (or PHP) or interested in freelancing? Then course is the perfect match for you. You will learn all the core PHP fundamentals you need to get started as a beginner PHP developer.
I've started several startups using PHP and it's allowed me to:
Build my dream applications from scratch
Travel the world 
Work from home (and work remotely around the world)
Find freelance work anywhere I go
Always have clients to work with
Always have money in the bank
PHP is one of the worlds most in-demand web languages. WordPress is a content management system that runs over 32% of ALL websites in the world, and it's built using PHP as its coding language. If you decided to learn just one coding language in your entire life, I would suggest PHP because of the high demand for WordPress websites. It's the money-making programming language.
If you know PHP, you can create: websites, content management systems, web applications and it will allow you to create startups like Facebook (Facebook actually used PHP!)
Everybody is excited to learn brand new languages, but the truth is: PHP runs so many websites it would be crazy NOT to learn PHP. Knowing PHP allowed me to travel the world and start a startup in Ireland — and it allows me to code from a beach! If you put economics, market demand and coding languages aside, this is the one language that's enabled me to have a better life. 
Why?
Over 1 in 3 websites use PHP. 32% of websites use WordPress which is built using PHP, plus there are tonnes of sites that use other content management systems, or use frameworks like Laravel (also built using PHP). 
You can literally find a job anywhere in the world if you know PHP. You can easily supplement your income, or change careers, if you know PHP.
Here are some of my students reviews (these are REAL 5 star reviews from my other PHP course)
Incredible PHP course*********
so far - this course is simple and easy to understand with clear direction and to the point info on exactly what you want to know
No fluff or nonsense*********
He is great! I love that he doesn't talk too much nonsense.
It doesn't take 37 hours*************
The instructor covered a lot of content in a fast but still understandable manner. Having the basics of PHP I can start making dynamic web pages. Thanks.
*********************End of Reviews *********************
My guarantee:
By the end of this course you will be a Junior PHP Developer. If you need help or get stuck, or just need further explanation... I am here for you (I don't have teach assistants to outsource questions to; you will get an answer directly from ME). I've created a free developer support group with over 13,000 web developer from around the world — that means 13,000 more chances for help, answers, clarity and support. But let's be honest: I'm a teacher, my success depends on your success... so I will make sure you succeed!
No nonsense or fluff:
Many other instructors like to talk your ear off, or tell unrelated stories, and say the same thing over and over again. Personally, I find that extremely boring and I won't subject you to that kind of nonsense. You're paying to learn a new skill, you're NOT paying to hear my life story. There's even a review from a student saying exactly this (above).
How I teach:
Every lesson is designed with a specific pattern to help maximize your learning time. It goes like this:
Learn the theory 
Learn the code 
Practice the code
I will teach you about a new subject, we will then dive directly into some code so you can see how it works in real life, and there is a task at the end of every lesson for immediate practice. You can watch some free previews if don't believe me. 
Other courses have a practice lesson at the end of a section — but I know you want (and need) practice right away, so every lesson has a practice task and it's up to you to decide if you want to do them or not.
Your investment:
You will be learning a skill that can set you free from a boring 9-5 job, help you change careers and help you make more money. If this course helped you earn an extra $1,000 this year, that'd be a great investment, right? Well... when you learn PHP, you can earn A LOT more than that. $1,000 is pennies compared to how much you could make. Or maybe money isn't your #1 motive... you can start a new company and make hobby websites and apps using PHP as your backend programming language.
Your risk:
Udemy has a 30 day money back guarantee. Don't like this course? Didn't have time to take the course? It doesn't matter what the reason is, you can request a refund. And I completely support this! I don't want your money if you are not going to learn from this course, that's an unfair trade in my opinion. You have NOTHING to lose by learning PHP with this course.
Commonly Asked Questions:
Q: Should I learn PHP?
A: ABSOLUTELY!
With over 1 in 3 websites using PHP and over 1,800,000,000 websites (1.8 billion websites as of 2018), it's the smart language to learn. That's over 600,000,000 websites using PHP. That's right. Six hundred MILLION websites. 
Q: Can you make money?
A: YES!
When you know PHP, contracts literally fall into your lap. To be honest, I turn down a lot of freelance work because I don't have time for it! Go to indeed dot com and search for PHP: you will see tens of thousands of jobs in the US! These are actual jobs, not just contracts (remote jobs included!)
Q: Will PHP be around in the future?
A: YES! 
According to the TIOBE Programming Index, it's the 8th most popular language in the world. And statistically speaking, it's the most popular backend programming language for websites. Remember, over 600,000,000 websites are using PHP (as of 2018).

PHP is basically used for developing web based software applications.
PHP is a great option for many reasons, so if you’re 
interviewing a company throwing around the PHP slag, here are some 
reasons why the language may be right for you or your project:
Fast Load Time – PHP results in faster 
site loading speeds. PHP codes runs much faster than ASP because it runs
 in its own memory space while ASP uses an overhead server and a COM 
based architecture.
Less Expensive Software – In working with PHP, most tools associated with the program are open source software, such as WordPress, so you need not pay for them. As for ASP, you might need to buy additional tools to work with its programs.
Less Expensive Hosting – ASP programs need
 to run on Windows servers with IIS installed. Hosting companies need to
 purchase both of these components in order for ASP to work, this often 
results in a more expensive cost for monthly hosting services. On the 
other hand, a PHP would only require running on a Linux server, which is
 available through a hosting provider at no additional cost.
Database Flexibility – PHP is flexible for
 database connectivity. It can connect to several databases the most 
commonly used is the MySQL.  MySQL can be used for free. If ASP is used,
 MS-SQL, a Microsoft product must be purchased.
This course helps you to build your base with PHP."

What other students are saying:
""After spending countless hours searching for a course or tutorial and purchasing two other courses that quite frankly were deep disappointments I am glad I didn't give up and found this course. Within
 a few hours I was able to create a basic login system for a website I'm
 launching for our department. I appreciated the fact that the content 
had been recently updated. The problem with the other courses and 
tutorials I viewed previously were using deprecated functions and it 
took me a while to figure out why things didn't work! As someone 
with little to no experience in coding php, the course was easy to 
understand and follow. I also appreciated the simplicity of the code so 
troubleshooting was easy to do. I am very happy with this course."" - Rosa Davis


""The course is very well structured and clear to understand and learn. The instructor is extremely knowledgeable and helpful. He even troubleshooted my code. Gladly recommend this course and the instructor."" - Saroj Thapa

Laravel is currently the most popular web framework. It is very much loved by developers because it makes development process easy and enjoyable while letting you build extremely powerful server side web applications.
But even if you have a good grasp of core PHP, you will find learning a framework like laravel very difficult and time consuming. That is because they are built around MVC pattern.

PHP is the stepping stone to your first professional development gigs
PHP is the most popular back end language on the web.
Companies like Facebook and Tumblr use PHP as their primary back end coding language. It's in universal demands, and, as a new developer you're expected to know you're way around the front end and the back end.  That's where PHP comes in.
There was a time when a web developer could get away with knowing just HTML and some Javascript-- but now as employers are looking for more value, you have to know more.  PHP lets you access an entire world of backend databases, like mySQL which is introduced in this course.
FACT:  With PHP knowledge you'll be able to complete more advanced projects and be more employable.
People ask all the time:  What's the best past to becoming a professional developer?
People going in to web development need two types of technical knowledge. First, they need to know how to manipulate content in a browser.  That's where HTML5 and Javascript come in.  But they also need to be able to interact with backend systems-- like eCommerce systems, databases and content management systems.

This course is meant for anyone looking to improve the way they build and distribute applications. You could be a web developer, sysadmin, operations manager, or someone who is part of an IT / testing / QA team.
By the time you finish this course you'll know everything you need to start using Docker / Docker Compose on your own projects.
This course was flawless in explaining every segment in detail while keeping it easy to follow along and learn. -- Brian K.
It doesn't matter if you use Ruby on Rails, NodeJS, Flask, Django, Java, Golang or any other language / framework. At the end of the day, Docker is a toolset that helps you package up and distribute your applications in a portable and repeatable way. You'll be able to set up entire development environments in a single command and run those same applications exactly the same in production with total confidence that it will work because you're just moving around special packages that Docker creates for you under the hood.
The days of ""well it works for me!"" or having to point another developer to a 20 page document on how to set up your web application are long over. Docker fixes those problems and so much more.
No prior Docker knowledge is necessary to take this course. We'll go all the way from ""What is Docker?"" to exploring what types of problems Docker solves to completely mastering Docker's core features (we'll cover Docker Compose in great depth too). Through out the process we'll go over Dockerizing simple web apps, complex multi-service web apps and I'll show you exactly how to Dockerize your own web apps.
I'm a big fan of learning by doing so this course has just enough theory combined with dozens of guided labs and challenges. This way you'll learn both the ""why"" and the ""how"".
Instead of sifting through 100+ scattered blog posts, this course lays everything out on a silver platter. I've done years of research and testing so you don't have to. All you have to do is sit back, relax and follow along with the videos. You're only a few short hours away from mastering Docker and applying it to your own applications.

I have been through very few learning experiences that were this thorough. Nick not only teaches you how to use Docker, but also how to troubleshoot Docker problems and research solutions. -- Dennis E.

However, until recently it was difficult to do this with micro-architectures composed of numerous containers that all need to work in conjunction with one another. Enter Docker Compose, the handiest tool to hit the tech world since Docker. Here’s everything you need to know... 

  
Learn Docker Compose Inside Out

Make Your Docker Experience Even More Stress-Free

This Docker Compose online course will make you a DC expert, learning the tool from top to bottom. It has been specifically designed for those that already know Docker, so you’ll skip the baby steps and dive straight in. First you’ll cover the basic features using a sample environment, gaining an understanding of restarts, dependencies, and persisting the database with a volume. 

  
After that you’ll progress to networks. You’ll take an in-depth look at isolating containers, aliases and container names, links, using external networks, and how updates affect networking. Then it’s on to the really good stuff; a section each is dedicated to volumes, logging, the Compose CLI, and ‘Composing Compose’ (don’t worry, it won’t be as complicated as it sounds by the time you get there).  Finally you’ll learn about Compose in Production.

  
The course is organised into logical sections so you can progress at your pace and in your own time. By the end, you’ll apply what you’ve learned to create a large environment for a sample legacy system, using all of the features covered in previous sections. You’ll then have the skills and confidence needed to go forth and create your own flexible application environments with Docker Compose. 

  
About Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a useful tool from the people at Docker. It makes defining and running application environments made up of multiple Docker containers even easier and more efficient.  Up until now, starting any more than one or two Docker containers was extremely complicated. With Docker Compose, the entire process just got infinitely better. "

During the past few years, Docker has completely changed the landscape of the software engineering industry. For developers, Docker is a must-know. For enterprises, Docker is a must-use.
Containers are revolutionary because they allow you as the developer to work with applications without the hassle of installing extra dependencies. With Docker, your coding environment will immediately set up. That way, you can spend your time focusing on the code that truly matters to you, your team, and your organization.
Docker and containerization also lies at the heart of development operations. Development engineers have the skills to both create and deploy applications. These kind of engineers hold a high value in the job market, and average higher salaries than software engineers. So knowing Docker will increase your DevOps skills and open doors for you.
How is this course designed?
This course is designed to introduce Docker and its core concepts. As a project-based course, you will become familiar with the main Docker commands as you build various applications with containers and images. The course centers around filmed tutorials, with notes accompanying each video. Go through a video for a deep understanding, and read the notes for a quick walk-through of main concepts and relevant commands. This gives you the power to go through the course at your own pace!

CI+CD Workflows? You will learn it.  AWS Deployment? Included.  Kubernetes in Production? Of course!
This is the ultimate course to learn how to deploy any web application you can possibly dream up.  Docker and Kubernetes are the newest tech in the Dev Ops world, and have dramatically changed the flow of creating and deploying web apps.  Docker is a technology that allows applications to run in constructs called 'containers', while Kubernetes allows for many different 'containers' to run in coordination.

Docker from Scratch!
In this course you'll learn Docker from absolute fundamentals, beginning by learning the answer to basic questions such as ""What is a container?"" and ""How does a container work?"".  From the very first few lectures, we will do a deep dive on the inner workings of containers, so you get a core understanding of exactly how they are implemented.  Once you understand what a container is, you'll learn how to work with them using basic Docker CLI commands.  After that, you'll apply your new-found mastery of the Docker CLI to build your own custom images, effectively 'Dockerizing' your own personal applications.  

CI + CD Pipelines
Of course, no course on Docker would be complete without a full understanding of common Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment patterns.  You will learn how to implement a full CI + CD workflow using Github, Travis CI, and Amazon Web Services, creating a pipeline that automatically deploys your code every time you push your latest changes to Github!

Multi-Container Deployments on AWS!
After building a deployment pipeline, you'll apply it to master both single-container and multi-container deployments on Amazon Web Services.  You will construct a multi-container application utilizing Node, React, Redis, and Postgres, and see the amazing power of containers in action (Note: all Javascript coding in this course is optional, the full source code is provided if you don't want to write JS).

Kubernetes!
Finally, you will tackle Kubernetes, a production-grade system for managing complex applications with many different running containers.  You will learn the right way to build a Kubernetes Cluster - this course doesn't have any of those annoying ""don't do this in production"" comments!  You will first build a Kubernetes Cluster on your local machine, then eventually move it over to a cloud provider.  You'll even learn how to set up HTTPS on Kubernetes, which is harder than it sounds!

Here's what you'll do:
Learn Docker from scratch, no previous experience required
Build your own custom images tailored to your applications
Master the Docker CLI to inspect and debug running containers
Understand how Docker works behind the scenes, and what a container is
Build a CI + CD pipeline from scratch with Github, Travis CI, and AWS
Automatically deploy your code when it is pushed to Github!
Build a complex multi-container application from scratch and deploy it to AWS
Understand the purpose and theory of Kubernetes
Deploy a production-ready Kubernetes Cluster to Google Cloud"

Developing Java applications in large enterprises is no easy task. Every day you are asked to work with many different technologies. In the morning, you might need to save data to a MySQL database. In the afternoon, you might be working with RabbitMQ. Tomorrow you might be asked to work with Mongo or Redis.
Think about what you need to do when working with all these different technologies.
If you install all these on your laptop, it becomes cluttered and slow. Sure, you could use VMs to run these - if you really want to slow down your laptop. Virtual Machines are awesome, but VMs can also be huge resource hogs. 
If you're on a dev team, you can set up dedicated development servers. But then you don't have a clean development environment. And your development work becomes dependent on access to the development servers.
Docker is an exciting technology you can leverage for enterprise development.
The popularity of Docker has been explosive. Much of the industry focus has been on DevOps. But more so on the Operations part.
Did you know Google creates roughly 285 MILLION Docker containers per day?
Docker is clearly a popular technology for running cloud scale applications like GMail. 
But as a Java developer, what does Docker mean to you?
Are you working with MySQL? There's a ready made Docker image for you.
Postgres? Mongo DB? Redis? Cassandra? RabbitMQ? ActiveMQ?
Yep, there's Docker images you can download and use today.
You can use Docker for a lot more than just your local development. 
Are you developing microservices? If you are not already deploying your microservices in Docker containers, chances are you soon will be.
Introduction to Docker
This course starts off assuming you have no knowledge about Docker. 
You will learn why Docker is not like a Virtual Machine. 
Right away, you will learn how to run a Docker container with a Docker Image pulled down from Docker hub.
As the course progresses, you will learn how to create your own Docker images and publish those images to Docker hub.
Java DevOps with Docker
Through the use of the Fabric8 Maven plugin, you will learn how to automate many Docker tasks, such as creating images for microservices. 
Docker Compose is a powerful tool to run multiple Docker containers. You will learn how to run how to run an application consisting of a Spring Boot web application, RabbitMQ, a page view microservice, and a MySQL database. Through Docker Compose, with a single command, you will be able to start or stop this application on any Docker machine!
Using Docker Swarm Mode
You'll learn how Docker Swarm Mode does container orchestration. In this course, you will provision your own Docker Swarm Cluster in the cloud. You will deploy a containerized Java application into a Docker Swarm Cluster. You'll see what a powerful feature Docker Swarm's routing mesh is, and how you can dynamically scale your application.

Containers are like that smart chef who can feed a whole family with just a bowl full of rice, and that's not an exaggeration at all! Containers are empowering businesses to scale fearlessly and manage their web apps hassle-free. They are the prime reason why micro and small enterprises are migrating to Cloud. All of this has undoubtedly led to an enormous demand of professionals with Containerization skills.
Which skills do you need?
A platform to Create, Run and Ship Containers... like Docker.
A strong tool to Control/Manage/Orchestrate your containers... like Kubernetes!
This Course takes you on a wonderful journey of learning Containers using key components of Docker and Kubernetes. All you need is very basic knowledge of Linux fundamentals like files and processes along with a bit of Linux command line. 

The Containerization Journey with Docker:
Calling Docker the most widely used containerization platform would be an understatement. It has literally become synonymous to containers! Following topics covered under this course will solidify the logical base of this statement.
You can only love a technology if you know how it works, and that's exactly why you will be learning Docker architecture and how its Components work.
At first glance, Dockerfile might seem like just another file describing app specifications. That's because it is probably the simplest yet efficient way to perform app building from scratch. 
Docker CLI is intuitive and is inspired by your friendly Linux CLI. So adapting it is a piece of cake! 
Docker images and Containers are the most portable and reliable way to ship your micro-service or web application without worrying about questions like ""will it work on his infrastructure?"" 
Once you are fairly familiar with containers, Docker Networks and Volumes will open a whole new world of opportunities. Your containerization will become more reliable and will start serving its true purpose.
Docker compose will combine all of learning and take it to a next level with inter-dependent multi-container applications.
Once you have learned all of this, you will be craving to know what else can you do with containers and how you can take your containerization skills to the next stage!

The Orchestration Journey with Swarm and Kubernetes:
""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility""
Similarly, With Great amount of containers, comes greater amount of orchestration!
You want to deploy 4 nodes on your cluster but can only afford  to have one SSD node. And you gotta make sure that it only hosts containers which demand SSD explicitly. What to do?
You don't want to have idle containers chilling around your nodes and not serving even 10% of their capacity but you also want to make sure that your customers don't hit 404 when traffic is at its peak. On top of that, you don't have time or manpower to keep your number of web-server replicas in-check. What to do? 
You are a pro on-premise kubernetes expert but your next project happens to be hosted on a public cloud platform like GCP or Azure. You're not scared but a little push will help you a lot! What to do?
This course is a one-stop answer for all of these questions. It covers both Kubernetes and Docker Swarm and makes sure that you are confident and capable to make your call when the time comes!
Even though a container orchestrator is nothing without containers themselves, kubernetes seems to be the biggest breakthrough in the world of DevOps. This course explains kubernetes from the start. No, I mean LITERALLY from the start (Origin! It,s an interesting story). It covers all of these important topics with examples so that when you finish this course, you can use and appreciate containers as well as we do!
Kubernetes Architecture (Components, States, Nodes, Interactions)
Kubernetes Objects (Pods, Handlers, Workloads, Controllers, Services, Volumes)
Operations (Sorting, Configuration, Scheduling, Scaling, Deploying, Updating, Restricting)
Application Examples (All-time favourite nginx webserver,Custom Landing Page, Stdout Logs, Wordpress blog with mysql, Apache zookeeper etc.)
Kubernetes as a service (GCP, Azure)
Case studies (Blackrock, Niantic)

Are you looking for the best way to learn how to build beautiful websites with CSS3? That even look great on your phone?
Have you taken other CSS courses, but still wonder how to code a real world website, not just some basic examples?
If your answer is a big YES... Then this is exactly the course you are looking for!
...
 
Reason #1: The course is completely property based
Together we will go through the entire CSS3 Property library.   
Reason #2: You will not just learn how to code
Coding is great, but it's not everything that matters. That's why we will go through the entire process of building and launching our website project. This includes designing, coding, planning, writing clean and organized code, website optimization, best practices, and so much more.
Designing is really, really important. Have you seen all these beautiful and modern websites lately? Great! Because I will show you how it's done. And not just in theory, but also in practice. This is the only course on the market which focuses on both coding and designing, together.
Reason #3: You walk away with a ready-to-launch website
By the end of the course, you will have a complete, ready-to-launch website that looks great on any computer, tablet and smartphone. Of course you get the entire code and all the images and graphical assets that I designed especially for the course as a free download.
Please check out the promo video to see the final website.
Reason #4: I make HTML5 and CSS3 easy and fun
With the right guidance, HTML5, CSS3 and responsive web design are really easy to learn and use in the real world. With a bunch of random tutorials and YouTube videos? Not so much. That's why I structured this training around a cool and complete project that's fun to code.
...
So here is exactly what we cover in this training:
• Easy-to-follow and hands-on web development with CSS3.
• Learn every CSS Property. 
• How to get and use images, fonts and icons to make your website shine — all for free.
• Responsive web design: learn how to create websites that work beautifully on all screen sizes.
• How to launch your website for the world to see it.
...
Let's now find out if this course is for you. It's a perfect fit if...
Student #1: You are a complete beginner with no idea on how to build a website.
Student #2: You already know some CSS3 from some tutorials or videos, but struggle to put together a good-looking, complete website.
Student #3: You are a designer and want to expand your skills in CSS3, because all your designer colleagues are learning how to code (they are smart).  
...
Now it's your turn to decide. This is what you get:
• Lifetime access to my HD quality videos. No monthly subscription. Learn at your own pace, whenever you want.
• English captions for students with hearing impairment.
• All lectures are downloadable to make your learning experience even better.
• Downloadable code and design assets for the entire project. You can keep this code as a starting point for your own projects.
• Free helpful support in the course Q&A when you have questions or get stuck.

There was a time when web sites didn't have to look great-- They were often designed by programmers with little or not design skill. People were forgiving of poor designs. 
Now, that has all changed. People expect your web site to not only be functional, but to look great.  CSS will give you the ability to completely style your webpage to catch the attention of your audience.
Where do you learn to style your webpage with CSS and impress your audience?
That’s what we’re here to talk about...
FACT: Strong CSS skills are what separate legit web developers from the hacks.
(...and CSS is an important part of web and mobile developers’ daily work)
We get the question all the time: I learned HTML, now what?
We don’t have to sell you on the idea of becoming a developer. If you’re you here, you already know it’s one of the most lucrative (and fastest growing) career tracks out there. It’s CSS that allows you to set yourself apart from other web and mobile developers. CSS developers:
In other other words, CSS skills are critical to all developers. CSS is essential to almost any development process.
That’s why businesses, design studios, development shops, and other organizations need developers well versed in CSS.
But there’s a problem. Most people who learned CSS learned it in school 12 years ago and have no idea that they’re doing.
That’s where YOU can separate yourself from the pack.
As a Certified CSS Specialist, you are qualified to write, maintain, and edit CSS documents. You'll be able to help development teams make content appealing and use CSS as an important piece of being a strong developer.
In this certification program you will learn:
In summary, certified CSS specialists are experts who are able to correctly construct CSS documents that can take any application to the next level. They are able to understand how CSS fits into the larger context of web and mobile development and work in serious development environments.
So, if you're interested in starting on the path to professional development:
What's Stopping You?  (and... Exactly Why You Might Want to Get Certified)
Honestly, anyone can claim they know CSS. So how do you separate the talkers from those who are true experts?
Technical skill verification is a huge problem...
We had the same issue here at LearnToProgram. Even though we primarily teach development, we also use development skills everyday on our own digital, online content and apps.
We’re teachers first, but we’re also developers.
We hire people with CSS and other web and mobile development skills to be part of our team... which is why we know it’s tough to find truly skilled people who know what they say they know.
That’s why we created not just another CSS course, but the CSS Specialist Designation.
We built this curriculum so that you can provide verification of your expertise. Anyone can claim to know CSS, but as a certified CSS expert, you have the designation and the skills to prove it.
How Does the Program Work?
First: Complete the Course
Each of the certification courses includes 5 to 10 hours of video training. Each course also includes lab exercises to help you retain the information in the video lectures. The courses feature study guides, practice questions, and activities, all with one goal: to help you learn new coding skills in CSS.
The courses are designed to be completed in a few days, if significant time is invested. However, you may spread the work out for as long as you’d like. There are no calendars or limits on individual courses. Simply work with the course until you’re confident that you’ve mastered the material.
Next: Pass the Exam
Once you complete the course, you'll be eligible to sit for the exam. The exam is composed of fifty multiple choice questions with a minimum passing score of 80%. The exam isn’t designed to be difficult, but to verify that you retained the information in the course. You have up to an hour to complete the exam. However, most people complete the exam much more quickly. If you don’t pass the exam the first time you take it, you may sit for the exam again.
When you pass the exam and complete the class, you’ll have earned your certification as a CSS specialist. Congratulations!
Receive Your Certificate and Badge
Now that you’re certified, you’ll receive your printable, full color digital certificate. Your certificate includes a link to a digital transcript page which will serve as verification of your achievement. You can place the badge on your personal website, portfolio, or resume. You also can automatically place the badge on your LinkedIn page.
Many individuals who receive these certifications place them in their email signature and other highly visible digital real estate to set them apart from other developers.
Who should get certified?
...Anyone else who wants this critical skillset and proof of expertise
Why Should You Be Certified?
If you’re interested in pursuing a career in development, then the CSS specialist designation is the place to continue your path. Almost every digital development project involves some level of CSS, and experts are in demand. If you’re a business owner, this certification course is a great way to learn what you need to know to style your own website. It’s also a great way to train the members of your team who work with your web site to ensure that they’re using the latest and best CSS practices. If you’re an agency or freelancer, the CSS specialist designation is a great way to validate your skills — and even justify a rate increase. If you’re a student, the CSS specialist designation separates you from other graduates and verifies that you possess specialized technical skills that all employers are seeking.
The CSS Specialist designation is tangible proof of your mastery of the critical CSS skillset and will drive up your value regardless of the environment in which you work."

CSS Stands for ""Cascading Style Sheet."" Cascading style sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages. They can be used to define text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages that previously could only be defined in a page's HTML.
CSS helps Web developers create a uniform look across several pages of a Web site. Instead of defining the style of each table and each block of text within a page's HTML, commonly used styles need to be defined only once in a CSS document. Once the style is defined in cascading style sheet, it can be used by any page that references the CSS file. Plus, CSS makes it easy to change styles across several pages at once. For example, a Web developer may want to increase the default text size from 10pt to 12pt for fifty pages of a Web site. If the pages all reference the same style sheet, the text size only needs to be changed on the style sheet and all the pages will show the larger text."

Frontend developers need to keep style sheets manageable and organized by taking a modular approach to building a website. They can either wrestle with it, or learn how to master it in order to easily apply layouts and styles with precision.
This web development video course has been designed to help you build your knowledge of CSS and master one of the most valuable tools in modern web design.
We start off with a brief review of the foundations of CSS by using a good text editor to automate your authoring and set up a CSS baseline. We then move on to creating a layout with floats and a functioning menu with dropdowns, taking a modular-organized approach to CSS. We'll also go into detail about CSS3 properties such as transforms, transitions, and animations. By the end, you'll have an understanding of responsive web design, web fonts, icon fonts, and techniques used to support retina devices; all things a modern frontend web developer must know.
We deep dive into a lot of details of CSS in this course, from creating a modern looking ghost button and a big call-to-action button to the supposedly difficult and scary SVG. Mastering CSS will arm you with all the knowledge, tips, and tricks you need to make you stand out in the world of developing complex, responsive, feature-rich web applications.

Structuring webpages by designing layouts and positioning content is very important when it comes to web design and web development. When the elements are positioned correctly in a webpage, the webpage becomes more structured and the content becomes easily visible and digestible. Web designers and developers take advantage of different CSS layout techniques to structure webpages as they need. CSS layout techniques allow us to define the placement of elements on a web page, that is to  control where they are positioned with respect to their default position as per normal flow, the other elements around them, their parent container, or the main viewport/window.
Suppose you want to create your own multi-column web site. But if you do not know where to start from or how to proceed, this course is for you. This course ""CSS Layout Techniques"" teaches you how to work with the common layout and positioning methods used in web design. In this course, you will learn different techniques to position elements on a webpage in nearly any imaginable way. Throughout the course, you will learn how to build layouts using display methods, floats, positioning techniques and even Flexbox which is the latest CSS layout model. At the end of the course, you will apply your positioning skills by working on real-world projects. You can decide which technique to use based on the content and goals of your webpage because some techniques are better than others in some context.
In this course, you start from the basics of CSS positioning techniques and gradually move to advanced concepts in CSS positioning. You will understand,
In the ""Knowledge into Action (Apply Your Knowledge)"" section, you will apply what you have learnt in this course to build layout and position elements from scratch. In the ""CSS Positioning with Real-World Projects (Hands-On Practices)"" section, you will do hands-on practices where you will practically implement CSS positioning techniques in some real-world projects.
By the end of this course, you will be able to

I've kept the old material and you can still access it at the end of the new course. The old course focused on the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, the new course is 100% project driven and teaches you how to build a professional website WHILE teaching the core HTML and CSS concepts along the way.
Hi and welcome to the HTML/CSS Bootcamp course, where we'll walk through the same course I teach code bootcamp students around the world. My name is Jordan Hudgens, and I'll be your instructor for the course. In addition to being the lead instructor for devCamp I've also been building web applications for over a decade for organizations such as Eventbrite and Quip.
In this course, you're going to learn all of the key skills that you're going to need in order to start building out professional websites. Before building this new course out, I interviewed hiring managers at companies around the world and asked them what HTML/CSS skills they expected developers to know and that's how I came up with the list of concepts that you're going to learn.
Some of the skills that you're going to learn are going to be:
HTML5
CSS3
Flexbox
CSS Grid
Animations
Media queries for building responsive layouts from scratch
CSS Selectors
Navigation
Fonts
Forms
How to integrate and style images
Front end development best practices
And much more!
As we go through the course material, you'll notice that I'm going to teach you my own process that I use whenever I'm building out a website.
My goal for this entire course isn't just to teach you how to build a single website, but instead my goal is to be able to leverage this project build that we're going to put together, teach you the fundamentals as we implement every single feature, and then by the end of it, you're not just going to be able to build the single website and follow along with what I do, but you'll be able to build any type of website.
There are no technical prerequisites for going through this course. This is the perfect course to go through if you want to learn how to build websites completely from scratch.
The ideal student is someone who is dedicated, wants to learn, and also wants to learn how to build websites using the most modern and up to date technologies. So, thank you for spending the time and going through this material, and good luck with the coding."

This is truly a topic that I really love. Perhaps you are just like me that in the very beginning you do not know how to do this. I`ve been there and eventually I decided to truly learn this wonderful skill. It took a really long time because this topic is not commonly discussed and secondly the skills are what you can call multi disciplinair. This means that you are not only dependent on one single programming language. 
You need to know a bunch of them all together and combine it in a way that is really challenging. However, one thing I still remember and this is what truly makes know thing this wonderful. It was the feeling of being able to do this, and making charts and dashboards in a way I always dreamed of. 
This course is a challenge, however, I describe it all in detail. It is in bite sizes and very easily done. If you follow you will get results and be able to do it yourself. However, do not neglect what you learn here. It took me truly months to understand all of these items and put them together as I did. 
This course is deeper then you would expect.
Since the topic is far more expensive then you could imagine you will notice that I will discuss it from every angle I possible can imagine. Ever heard of a planned and unplanned database? Well, so many options are possible and this creates a real challenge. 
Your database might not be build for Charts but you are not able to change it and must work with what you`ve got. I get it and this is also what I learned to do. You might have a different structure and want to combine it all together in a database. Well, I understand this as well. 
When I created this course I focused on the database connection but in reality that is just the tip of the iceberg. The connection is one part, having the right database structure is the second, and making it dynamic is a completely different level. I`m talking about AJAX and JS functions (if you are experienced) you will know what I'm referring to.  And of course knowing how to connect everything with the updating function of Chart JS. Well be ready!
Items in this course will be sometimes repetitive. I really did this on purpose because this is how I learned this well. If you create 10 different charts with all kind of connection structure you will be really good. Because the experience you gain from doing this is really worth it. After that you basically could dream it. Although the challenge of this is really different every single time. 
ChartJS is really fascinating and somehow I truly love to see how those charts come to life and start to tell a story with numbers. I sincerely hope you enjoy this course as well. One of the things that always give me a spark of joy is seeing a chart in action the moment it is connected. It might sound weird but seeing your chart change by a click of a button or connected with a database is very similar to seeing seed becoming a plant. It is fascinating how it can grow. Not because of the growth but once you know this, you see yourself growing and all the new possibilities you can do with a chart. 
I hope I can transfer some passion charts into you and I sincerely hope it gives your the inspiration to truly take this course. Not for me,... but for yourself. See how your new gained intelligence will make your skills bloom even further then you can imagine. I ask you to try it to explore how far you can blossom!

Leading industry giants are finding Azure to fulfill their  extensive cloud requirements. With the Azure cloud adoption going at a  faster pace, some frustration comes in as well. Public Cloud definitely  makes deploying workloads a lot faster, but it doesn’t always makes  things easier. That’s why you still need to understand the platform  capabilities, and having the knowledge to really design and architect  your future datacenter strategy. And that’s exactly what this course  will teach you.
In this module, we highlight one of the most common scenarios in an  Azure adoption project, mainly designing and integrating Azure Virtual  Machine topologies. Just like building out your VM architecture in a  typical on-premises datacenter, this course is logically structured in  that way. Starting from designing Azure Virtual Networking  architectures, both within Azure and for Hybrid scenarios, we move over  to an in-depth view on Azure Virtual Machines. What VM sizes are  available and how to decide which ones to use, how to deploy VMs in a  couple of different ways, as well as how to streamline Azure VM  configurations, are the key objectives of this topic. 
Next, viewers will learn how to architect high-availability setups for  Azure VM workloads. In the last section of this course, viewers will get  a good understanding of what platform monitoring solutions Azure  provides today, by zooming in on Operations Management Suite, Azure  Monitor and Azure Log Analytics.

Because now it works. With the arrival of cloud computing and multi-core machines - we have enough compute capacity at our disposal to churn large volumes of data and dig out the hidden patterns contained in these mountains of data.
This technology comes in handy, especially when handling Big Data. Today, companies collect and accumulate data at massive, unmanageable rates for website clicks, credit card transactions, GPS trails, social media interactions, and so on. And it is becoming a challenge to process all the valuable information and use it in a meaningful way. This is where machine learning algorithms come into the picture. These algorithms use all the collected “past” data to learn patterns and predict results or insights that help us make better decisions backed by actual analysis.
You may have experienced various examples of Machine Learning in your daily life (in some cases without even realizing it). Take for example 
In all these examples, machine learning is used to build models from historical data, to forecast the future events with an acceptable level of reliability. This concept is known as Predictive analytics. To get more accuracy in the analysis, we can also combine machine learning with other techniques such as data mining or statistical modeling.
This progress in the field of machine learning is great news for the tech industry and humanity in general. But the downside is that there aren’t enough data scientists or machine learning engineers who understand these complex topics.
Well, what if there was an easy to use a web service in the cloud - which could do most of the heavy lifting for us? What if scaled dynamically based on our data volume and velocity?
The answer - is new cloud service from Microsoft called Azure Machine Learning. Azure Machine Learning is a cloud-based data science and machine learning service which is easy to use and is robust and scalable like other Azure cloud services. It provides visual and collaborative tools to create a predictive model which will be ready-to-consume on web services without worrying about the hardware or the VMs which perform the calculations.
The advantage of Azure ML is that it provides a UI-based interface and pre-defined algorithms that can be used to create a training model. And it also supports various programming and scripting languages like R and Python. 
In this course, we will discuss Azure Machine Learning in detail. You will learn what features it provides and how it is used. We will explore how to process some real-world datasets and find some patterns in that dataset.

You've been working on this app for months. You finally publish it live, and you start letting people know about it. Then you have a new set of problems - checking the CPU usage, worrying about performance, almost hoping that it doesn't get too popular too fast. Do you have to spin up more servers in advance in case there is a spike in demand?
Azure Serverless apps promises to take the stress and worry about application scaling off your hands. If you code your application using logic apps, functions, messages, and events, Azure will add more server power when your application needs it, and will take care of scaling back down when you don't. And you only pay for what you use. No hourly compute charges when a server is running but not doing much.
In this course, we'll look at all of the components of an Azure Serverless app. 
Beyond the overview, we'll also look at the Azure Portal and see live walkthroughs of creating Serverless apps. Then you'll have a chance to do it yourself using Assignments. 
To be sure, Azure Serverless apps aren't perfect or for every situation. Virtual Machines aren't going away. But there are some great uses for these small functions that have specific tasks to perform, and in this course we'll look at how to add Serverless apps to your toolbox.

This course provides a comprehensive overview of Design Patterns in C# and .NET from a practical perspective. This course in particular covers patterns with the use of:
This course provides an overview of all the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns as outlined in their seminal book, together with modern-day variations, adjustments, discussions of intrinsic use of patterns in the language.
What are Design Patterns?
Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems. They were popularized with the 1994 book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson and Richard Helm (who are commonly known as a Gang of Four, hence the GoF acronym).
The original book was written using C++ and Smalltalk as examples, but since then, design patterns have been adapted to every programming language imaginable: C#, Java, PHP and even programming languages that aren't strictly object-oriented, such as JavaScript.
The appeal of design patterns is immortal: we see them in libraries, some of them are intrinsic in programming languages, and you probably use them on a daily basis even if you don't realize they are there.
What Patterns Does This Course Cover?
This course covers all the GoF design patterns. In fact, here's the full list of what is covered:
Who Is the Course For?
This course is for .NET/C# developers who want to see not just textbook examples of design patterns, but also the different variations and tricks that can be applied to implement design patterns in a modern way. For example, the introduction of the DLR allows us to use an ImpromptuObject, so that our DynamicObject exposes any interface we desire. This allows for dynamic programming, and many design patterns are presented in terms of their static and DLR-based variations.
Presentation Style
This course is presented as a (very large) series of live demonstrations being done in Microsoft Visual Studio. Most demos are single-file, so you can download the file attached to the lesson and run it in Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Rider or another IDE of your choice.
This course does not use UML class diagrams; all of demos are live coding. I use Visual Studio, various NuGet packages, R# unit test runner and even dotMemoryUnit.

Below are some of the topics we cover.; HTML & CSS terminology; The 5 different types of positioning; Depth management; Common display types; Padding; Margins; Borders; TranslateX and Y,"I’ve been making websites since 2007. And one of the largest chunks of knowledge I had to acquire was learning the basics of web-design layout. In design apps we drag and drop. We align. We group. We set widths, heights, and x & y positions. We have a layers panel. We have super-fine control. But the design in the Photoshop or Sketch is not the final website, even if the filename is web-FINAL final.psd. The final website is the one in the browser. It’s the one in front of your customer. And the skill of knowing how to describe a design to a browser using HTML & CSS is one of the best skills you can have.  HTML & CSS are a descriptive design language pair that can learned, just like you learned to use Sketch or Photoshop.
This class will show you how to describe layouts to the browser, what the defaults are, how to override them, and when to override them. You’ll understand more of how the browser works and how it differs from web design apps. It will change how you design, and you may even start designing in the browser more (like I do). Knowing your tools is super beneficial. And as a designer, or developer, knowing how layout in a browser works will allow you to work quicker and more decisively.

This course provides a comprehensive overview of Design Patterns in Modern C++ from a practical perspective. This course in particular covers patterns with the use of:
This course provides an overview of all the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns as outlined in their seminal book, together with modern-day variations, adjustments, discussions of intrinsic use of patterns in the language.
What are Design Patterns?
Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems. They were popularized with the 1994 book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson and Richard Helm (who are commonly known as a Gang of Four, hence the GoF acronym).
The original book was written using C++ and Smalltalk as examples, but since then, design patterns have been adapted to every programming language imaginable: Swift, C#, Java, PHP and even programming languages that aren't strictly object-oriented, such as JavaScript.
The appeal of design patterns is immortal: we see them in libraries, some of them are intrinsic in programming languages, and you probably use them on a daily basis even if you don't realize they are there.
What Patterns Does This Course Cover?
This course covers all the GoF design patterns. In fact, here's the full list of what is covered:
Who Is the Course For?
This course is for C++ developers who want to see not just textbook examples of design patterns, but also the different variations and tricks that can be applied to implement design patterns in a modern way.
Presentation Style
This course is presented as a (very large) series of live demonstrations being done in JetBrains CLion. Most demos are single-file, so you can download the file attached to the lesson and run it in CLion, XCode or another IDE of your choice (or just on the command line).
This course does not use UML class diagrams; all of demos are live coding."

My name is Jana and I’ll be your instructor guiding you through this course.
I’m teaching chatbot and smart assistants here on Udemy. I also do consulting for clients.

And what I’ve noticed is that many clients are confused when going from graphical interface to a conversational interface. Where most of companies fail is to deliver a satisfying user experience and that is why people leave the bot never coming back. 

In this course I will guide you through the most common misconceptions of voice and chatbot design. And I’ll introduce SOLUTIONS. You’ll be able to implement them along the way. You’ll improve your chatbot and voice interface as we move along the course.

In the first part we focus on chatbots and designing conversations for chatbots. And in the second part we focus on Voice interfaces and designing conversations for voice bots. Designing for voice interfaces and chatbots have some important differences. Avoid common mistakes that prevent good user experience.


One thing is true. Knowing the technology on how to create a chatbot is not enough. It’s only a start. What you need to know is how to build great conversational interfaces. 
It’s like when apps emerged. Many people have taken a web app and converted it into a mobile app, witch was not a good solution.
And now people take their frequently asked questions and turn them into a bot. This is a start, I agree.
But for a good user experience you need more. And what that is you’ll learn in this course.
This course is packt with many hands on tutorials. We learn by looking at examples and applying the knowledge right away. 
Plus I also offer 100%, no questions asked, money back guarantee.

Conversational interfaces are just at the beginning stage. And the best conversational apps will emerge in the next few years. Yours can be one of them.

Why do users get frustrated in attempt to communicate with chatbots? How can we prevent this and keep our users satisfied?
 And yes, how can we engage users? And build a satisfying relationship that is more personal and more human like - using conversational interfaces?
This are questions we’ll answer in this course.
This course has thousands of examples on how not to chatbot. And most important, even more examples on how to make conversation with a bot a satisfying experience.
I’ve made a in-depth research, talked to many professionals, looked at thousands of examples. 

What we’ll cover in this course is introduction to conversational interfaces, chatbots and voice interfaces. We’ll cover how they can benefit us and where they are of best use.
Then we dive deeper into chatbots. We’ll see where things go wrong, and where we can start when developing a chatbot. We’ll talk about basics of designing a conversation and how to communicate with a user. We’ll talk about the chat components like special commands and handling error messages. We’ll talk about chatbot as a search agent and the bot’s personality. Then we go more into development and maintenance and analytics. Developing a chatbot is not a do and forget thing. As you will see in the course.
After we cover this and more on the topics of chatbots, we’ll go into voice. We’ll cover use cases and I will help you avoid one common mistake done by voice bot developers. That is assuming that developing for chatbot and voice bot is one and the same thing. Voice and chat have some major differences that need to be considered as developing a bot. And by incorporating these into the design you’ll save your customer unnecessary frustration. The same as with chatbots I will tell you what are the mistakes to avoid. And what are the best practices you can use. And we’ll go into details like designing prompts and more. 

Do remember:
I’M HERE FOR YOU! I WILL ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS AND RESPOND TO ALL YOUR SUGGESTIONS!

Now let’s get started.

""Clear, direct and to the point.
Great job! This course if perfect for beginners and was well worth the money. The informative powerpoints were a bonus too.
This course teaches you how to design PCBs well enough (schematics & board files) to send to a manufacturer.
It doesn't touch on 3D parts files or viewing the board in 3D, and doesn't go into too much detail about how to layout a silkscreen properly, but these are more advanced features anyway.
Thanks Amit, 9/10""

Everything humans interact with has an experience associated with it. Some are good, some are bad, but it is only recently that have we begun to consciously design these experiences. We are now at a point in time when experience-design has suddenly exploded into the consciousness of business people and ordinary people all over the world.
This breakthrough guide will help you understand and define your users and build empathy for their potential problems. We’ll start our journey by looking at human-centered observations, where you will learn different types of observation methods, and also learn about human-centered design. Also understand Empathy building by defining Proto persona.
Next, you will learn how to build, design, and test your persona. Moving on, dive into observing user habits and technology, where you will see the difference in good and bad habits. You’ll also find out how to set up a new habit and design. Finally, take a look at Human Insights and get started writing your own Insights from a User Point of View.

    This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Design patterns in Java with practical hands on exercises. To learn about the design patterns using Java programming language we'll discuss:    
This course covers all the classic design patterns from the Gang of Four (GoF) book. In addition we'll discuss few newer design patterns that are used in modern software development. We'll discuss how a pattern can be implemented in various ways & how we can tailor them to be used with Java language.
So, what are Design Patterns & why should you care?
    Design patterns represent solutions to common problems, which you face while doing programming. These solutions are reusable and can solve a wide variety of problems. These became popular with the release of classic book on the subject ""Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"" writtern by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson and Richard Helm (these authors are known as Gang of Four and so the common abbreviation GoF book :) )    One problem while studying this book as a Java developer is that the authors are using C++ to demonstrate a pattern, which was the most popular & widely used programming language at the time. So you'll see examples using C++ language features like pointers, copy constructors etc. which do not translate easily to Java.     This course will help greatly in that aspect. We'll study each design pattern using Java language to its full potential.
What is covered in this course?
    This course covers 26 design patterns in all. We'll cover following design patterns:
    Each design patterns is also implemented in a follow along coding lecture.
How the Course is Structured?
    We focus on live coding along with theory. Each design is implemented in a live coding session (which you can follow along) as well as discussed with UML & slides. After studing a section you'll know almost everything about the design pattern.
    This course is created with focus on being used as a reference. So each design pattern is discussed in it's own section with a separated lecture for each aspect of the design pattern. Each section is organized as following lectures:    1. Introduction - This lecture introduces pattern, a problem that it solves & a formal UML diagram    2. Implementation Steps - This lecture will discuss how you'll implement this pattern in Java.    3. Example UML - We discuss the UML of the hands on problem we're going to solve.    4. Implementation - In this lecture we'll implement the design pattern in Java using Eclipse IDE    5. Implementation & Design Considerations - Some important points about performance, variations & practical advice on using the pattern    6. Real World Example - In this lecture we'll see how the pattern is used in real life by Java's own class library & popular frameworks like Spring, JSF    7. Comparison with Similar pattern - See how the pattern is different than another similar pattern.    8. Pitfalls - Many pattern have some drawbacks. This lecture will show you what those are.    9. Summary - This lecture will summarise all the information about the pattern.
    As you can see, by breaking a single design pattern in smaller topics, you can easily watch only those parts that you need in future.

Material Design is one of those many other types of designing languages like Flat Design, Metro Design, Realism Design etc. Material Design does differ to other types in terms of colors, typography, shapes, patterns and layout. But Material Design adds something very new to design language i.e, Motion and Stacking.
Google encourages developers to use Material Design to design their websites and apps because it let's you create a visual language that synthesizes classic principles of good design with the innovation.
In this course you will learn to design websites and hybrid apps using Material Design from scratch. We will create a portfolio site with multiple pages. Then we will learn designing hybrid apps using Material design by deploying the same site on Cordova container. Let's get started."

CI+CD Workflows? You will learn it.  AWS Deployment? Included.  Kubernetes in Production? Of course!
This is the ultimate course to learn how to deploy any web application you can possibly dream up.  Docker and Kubernetes are the newest tech in the Dev Ops world, and have dramatically changed the flow of creating and deploying web apps.  Docker is a technology that allows applications to run in constructs called 'containers', while Kubernetes allows for many different 'containers' to run in coordination.

Docker from Scratch!
In this course you'll learn Docker from absolute fundamentals, beginning by learning the answer to basic questions such as ""What is a container?"" and ""How does a container work?"".  From the very first few lectures, we will do a deep dive on the inner workings of containers, so you get a core understanding of exactly how they are implemented.  Once you understand what a container is, you'll learn how to work with them using basic Docker CLI commands.  After that, you'll apply your new-found mastery of the Docker CLI to build your own custom images, effectively 'Dockerizing' your own personal applications.  

CI + CD Pipelines
Of course, no course on Docker would be complete without a full understanding of common Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment patterns.  You will learn how to implement a full CI + CD workflow using Github, Travis CI, and Amazon Web Services, creating a pipeline that automatically deploys your code every time you push your latest changes to Github!

Multi-Container Deployments on AWS!
After building a deployment pipeline, you'll apply it to master both single-container and multi-container deployments on Amazon Web Services.  You will construct a multi-container application utilizing Node, React, Redis, and Postgres, and see the amazing power of containers in action (Note: all Javascript coding in this course is optional, the full source code is provided if you don't want to write JS).

Kubernetes!
Finally, you will tackle Kubernetes, a production-grade system for managing complex applications with many different running containers.  You will learn the right way to build a Kubernetes Cluster - this course doesn't have any of those annoying ""don't do this in production"" comments!  You will first build a Kubernetes Cluster on your local machine, then eventually move it over to a cloud provider.  You'll even learn how to set up HTTPS on Kubernetes, which is harder than it sounds!

Here's what you'll do:
Learn Docker from scratch, no previous experience required
Build your own custom images tailored to your applications
Master the Docker CLI to inspect and debug running containers
Understand how Docker works behind the scenes, and what a container is
Build a CI + CD pipeline from scratch with Github, Travis CI, and AWS
Automatically deploy your code when it is pushed to Github!
Build a complex multi-container application from scratch and deploy it to AWS
Understand the purpose and theory of Kubernetes
Deploy a production-ready Kubernetes Cluster to Google Cloud"

Get those skills with this course! It's is a great chance to work on a real K8S project, and to get yourself to a high professional standard on real projects.
All the way through the course you'll be working on realistic requirements - but you don't need to be a coder or know any particular programming language - I've prepared for you a set of Docker images, and your job is to use Kubernetes to get these images running. 
The system is a Microservice based architecture, and along the way we'll look at design decisions and trade-offs you need to make when managing these complex systems. Note the course isn't about how to design Microservices (although we'll certainly be talking about that); the development work is done and we need to get the system running on a production cluster.
We'll also discover that the developers have made some bad mistakes in their code, by analysing the run time performance of the cluster!
You can do the first part of the course on your local development computer (PC/Mac/Laptop). The second part (from Chapter 13 onwards) moves to the cloud. You'll use a real AWS account, and we go ahead to set up monitoring with the ELK/Elastic Stack and monitor with Prometheus and Grafana.
I've designed this course for a wide audience - whether you're a DevOps engineer, a developer or if you're quite new to the whole field, I'll explain everything along the way. Just some basic knowledge of working with computers, and maybe a bit of command line experience will suffice.
You will need an AWS account for chapters 13-17 if you want to work on the system yourself. If you're new to AWS then don't worry, I've got you covered -but Amazon will charge you for running the system (as with all/most cloud providers). Expect to pay no more than around 10USD for this (this is a safe overestimate), but you are expected to manage this spend yourself and you must delete your Kubernetes cluster at the end of your session. Don't let that put you off, it's a great investment.
As always, I'm here to answer questions and I aim to respond within 48 hours.
Good luck!"

Containers are like that smart chef who can feed a whole family with just a bowl full of rice, and that's not an exaggeration at all! Containers are empowering businesses to scale fearlessly and manage their web apps hassle-free. They are the prime reason why micro and small enterprises are migrating to Cloud. All of this has undoubtedly led to an enormous demand of professionals with Containerization skills.
Which skills do you need?
A platform to Create, Run and Ship Containers... like Docker.
A strong tool to Control/Manage/Orchestrate your containers... like Kubernetes!
This Course takes you on a wonderful journey of learning Containers using key components of Docker and Kubernetes. All you need is very basic knowledge of Linux fundamentals like files and processes along with a bit of Linux command line. 

The Containerization Journey with Docker:
Calling Docker the most widely used containerization platform would be an understatement. It has literally become synonymous to containers! Following topics covered under this course will solidify the logical base of this statement.
You can only love a technology if you know how it works, and that's exactly why you will be learning Docker architecture and how its Components work.
At first glance, Dockerfile might seem like just another file describing app specifications. That's because it is probably the simplest yet efficient way to perform app building from scratch. 
Docker CLI is intuitive and is inspired by your friendly Linux CLI. So adapting it is a piece of cake! 
Docker images and Containers are the most portable and reliable way to ship your micro-service or web application without worrying about questions like ""will it work on his infrastructure?"" 
Once you are fairly familiar with containers, Docker Networks and Volumes will open a whole new world of opportunities. Your containerization will become more reliable and will start serving its true purpose.
Docker compose will combine all of learning and take it to a next level with inter-dependent multi-container applications.
Once you have learned all of this, you will be craving to know what else can you do with containers and how you can take your containerization skills to the next stage!

The Orchestration Journey with Swarm and Kubernetes:
""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility""
Similarly, With Great amount of containers, comes greater amount of orchestration!
You want to deploy 4 nodes on your cluster but can only afford  to have one SSD node. And you gotta make sure that it only hosts containers which demand SSD explicitly. What to do?
You don't want to have idle containers chilling around your nodes and not serving even 10% of their capacity but you also want to make sure that your customers don't hit 404 when traffic is at its peak. On top of that, you don't have time or manpower to keep your number of web-server replicas in-check. What to do? 
You are a pro on-premise kubernetes expert but your next project happens to be hosted on a public cloud platform like GCP or Azure. You're not scared but a little push will help you a lot! What to do?
This course is a one-stop answer for all of these questions. It covers both Kubernetes and Docker Swarm and makes sure that you are confident and capable to make your call when the time comes!
Even though a container orchestrator is nothing without containers themselves, kubernetes seems to be the biggest breakthrough in the world of DevOps. This course explains kubernetes from the start. No, I mean LITERALLY from the start (Origin! It,s an interesting story). It covers all of these important topics with examples so that when you finish this course, you can use and appreciate containers as well as we do!
Kubernetes Architecture (Components, States, Nodes, Interactions)
Kubernetes Objects (Pods, Handlers, Workloads, Controllers, Services, Volumes)
Operations (Sorting, Configuration, Scheduling, Scaling, Deploying, Updating, Restricting)
Application Examples (All-time favourite nginx webserver,Custom Landing Page, Stdout Logs, Wordpress blog with mysql, Apache zookeeper etc.)
Kubernetes as a service (GCP, Azure)
Case studies (Blackrock, Niantic)

Container technologies, in combination with orchestration, provide significant advantages in the way companies deploy and operate their enterprise software.
This raises the question: Are enterprise applications developed with Java EE eligible for these technologies; if so, how can this transition be accomplished?
This course will show you how it is possible to develop Java EE 8 applications that run in containers. We will see why Java EE specifically is a natural fit for containers.
This course starts with practical ways on how you can use Docker in Java EE 8 and how to troubleshoot containers. You will run Java EE in containers. This course will also teach you how to configure containerized applications. Also you will orchestrate containers using Kubernetes.
By the end of the course, you will be able to Integrate Java EE applications into Kubernetes.

What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration technology system .Kubernetes is mainly used for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications.
Kubernetes was originally designed by Google and then open sourced.And from then to now Kubernetes is maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. 
Kubernetes  aims to provide a ""platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts It works with a range of container tools, including Docker.
Kubernetes is a portable as well as extensible platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. Kubernetes  has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. There are widely availablity in Kubernetes services, support, and tools.
Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience that Google has with running production workloads at scale, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.
Even though Kubernetes provides a lot of functionality, there are always new scenarios that would benefit from new features. Application-specific workflows can be streamlined to accelerate developer velocity. Ad hoc orchestration that is acceptable initially often requires robust automation at scale. This is why Kubernetes was also designed to serve as a platform for building an ecosystem of components and tools to make it easier to deploy, scale, and manage applications.
Labels in Kubernetes empower users to organize their resources however they please. Annotations enable users to decorate resources with custom information to facilitate their workflows and provide an easy way for management tools to checkpoint state.
The Kubernetes control plane is mainly built upon the same APIs that are available to developers and users. Users can write their own controllers, such as schedulers, with their own APIs that can be targeted by a general-purpose command-line tool.
This design has enabled a number of other systems to build the Kubernetes.
On the other hand Kubernetes is not a traditional or all-inclusive Platform as a Service( PaaS) system. Since Kubernetes operates at the container level rather than at the hardware level, it provides some generally applicable features common to PaaS offerings, such as deployment, scaling, load balancing, logging, and monitoring. However, Kubernetes is not monolithic, and these default solutions are optional and pluggable. Kubernetes provides the building blocks for building developer platforms but preserves user choice and flexibility where it is important.
 
Here are some advantages of Kubernetes 
Firstly Kubernetes does not limit the types of applications supported. Moreover, Kubernetes aims to support an extremely diverse variety of workloads, including stateless and stateful even data-processing workloads. Thatswhy If an application can run in a container, it should run great on Kubernetes.
Kubernetes never  deploy source code and does not build your application. Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment (CI/CD) workflows are determined by organization cultures and preferences as well as technical requirements.
Kubernetes does not provide application-level services, such as middleware (e.g., message buses), data-processing frameworks (for example, Spark), databases like MySQL, caches as built-in services. Such components can run on Kubernetes, and/or can be accessed by applications running on Kubernetes through portable mechanisms, such as the Open Service Broker.
Kubernetes never dictate logging, monitoring, or alerting solutions. It provides some integrations as proof of concept, and mechanisms to collect and export metrics.
Kubernetes does not also provide nor mandate a configuration language/system (e.g., jsonnet). It provides a declarative API that may be targeted by arbitrary forms of declarative specifications.
Kubernetes never provide nor adopt any comprehensive machine configuration, maintenance, management, or self-healing systems.
Though Kubernetes is not a mere orchestration system. In fact,kubernetes eliminates the need for orchestration. In contrast, Kubernetes is comprised of a set of independent, composable control processes.Kubernetes also drive the current state continuously towards the provided desired state. 
 
What is Kubernetes for ?
Kubernetes is an open source system for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts, providing basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications.In short, Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool from Google.

How Does Kubernetes work?
Kubernetes can mainly defines as a set of building blocks.Kubernetes collectively provides mechanisms that deploy, maintain and scale applications. Kubernetes is loosely coupled and extensible to meet different workloads. This extensibility is provided in large part by the Kubernetes API, which is used by internal components as well as extensions and containers that run on Kubernetes

There are some key components which are widely used is Kuberntes are
Pods
Labels and selectors
Controllers
Services

What is the pod in Kubernetes
A Kubernetes pod is a group of containers. Pods can be deployed together on the same host. If you frequently deploy single containers, you can generally replace the word ""pod"" with ""container"" and accurately understand the concept.
Pods operate at one level higher than individual containers because it's very common to have a group of containers work together to produce an artifact or process a set of work.
For example, consider this pair of containers: a caching server and a cache ""warmer"". You could build these two functions into a single container, but now they can each be tailored to the specific task and shared between different projects.
 
What is labels and selectors in Kubernetes?
Labels and selectors are the primary grouping mechanism in Kubernetes and determine the components an operation applies to.
Labels are key-value pairs that are attached to Kubernetes objects, such as Pods. They are intended to be used to specify object attributes which are meaningful and relevant to users, while not directly impacting implying semantics of the core system.
Unlike names and UIDs, labels in Kubernetes do not provide uniqueness. In general, we expect many objects to carry the same label(s).
 Via a label selector, the client/user can identify a set of objects. The label selector is the core grouping primitive in Kubernetes.
The API currently supports two types of selectors: equality-based and set-based. A label selector can be made of multiple requirements which are comma-separated. In the case of multiple requirements, all must be satisfied so the comma separator acts as a logical AND (&&) operator. 

What is Controllers  in Kubernetes?
A controller is a reconciliation loop that drives actual cluster state toward the desired cluster state. It does this by managing a set of pods. One kind of controller is a replication controller, which handles replication and scaling by running a specified number of copies of a pod across the cluster. It also handles creating replacement pods if the underlying node fails. Other controllers that are part of the core Kubernetes system include a ""DaemonSet Controller"" for running exactly one pod on every machine or some subset of machines and a ""Job Controller"" for running pods that run to completion, as part of a batch job. The set of pods that a controller manages is determined by Kubernetes label selectors that are part of the controller’s definition.

What is Services in Kubernetes?
A Kubernetes service is a set of pods which can work together, such as one tier of a multi-tier application. The set of pods that constitute a service are defined by a label selector.Kubernetes provides service discovery and request routing by assigning a stable IP address and DNS name to the service, and load balances traffic in a round-robin manner to network connections of that IP address among the pods matching the selector even as failures cause the pods to move from machine to machine.By default, a service is exposed inside a cluster but a service can also be exposed outside a kubernetes cluster.

Why you should start learning Kubernetes?
When our clients ask us to create a highly available distributed system, we usually recommend Kubernetes, because Kubernetes is really easy to use and even though it has a steep initial learning curve and kubernetes still a lot more simple than other competing orchestration engines.
Kubernetes also works perfectly with Node apps because it's based on Docker.Thatswhy  you can run any kind of application using Kubernetes. 
As we all know kubernetes is a open source project spun out of Google which  automates the process of deploying and managing multi-container applications at scale. While Kubernetes works mainly with Docker, it can also work with any container system that conforms to the Open Container Initiative (OCI) standards for container image formats and runtimes. 
And because Kubernetes is open source, with relatively few restrictions on how it can be used, it can be used freely by anyone who wants to run containers, most anywhere they want to run them.
Kubernetes introduces new abstractions and concepts, and the learning curve for Kubernetes is high so it is only normal to ask what the long-term payoffs are for using Kubernetes. Here’s a rundown of some of the specific ways running apps inside Kubernetes becomes easier.
Kubernetes manages app health, replication, load balancing, and hardware resource allocation for you. One of the most basic duties Kubernetes takes off your hands is the busywork of keeping an application up, running, and responsive to user demands. Apps that become “unhealthy,” or don’t conform to the definition of health you describe for them, can be automatically healed using kubernetes.
Another benefit of Kubernetes is that it maximizes the use of hardware resources including memory, storage I/O, and network bandwidth. Applications can have soft and hard limits set on their resource usage. Many apps that use minimal resources can be packed together on the same hardware; apps that need to stretch out can be placed on systems. And again, rolling out updates across a cluster, or rolling back if updates break, can be automated.
Kubernetes Helm charts ease the deployment of preconfigured applications. Package managers such as Debian Linux’s APT and Python’s Pip save users the trouble of manually installing and configuring an application. This is especially handy when an application has multiple external dependencies.
Helm is something like a package manager for Kubernetes. Many popular software applications must run as multiple, ganged-together containers in Kubernetes. Helm provides a definition mechanism, a “chart,” that describes how a given piece of software can be run as a group of containers inside Kubernetes.
Kubernetes simplifies management of storage, secrets, and other application-related resources. Containers are meant to be immutable; whatever you put into them isn’t supposed to change. But applications need state so it means they need a reliable way to deal with external storage volumes. That’s made all the more complicated by the way containers live, die, and are reborn across the lifetime of an app.
Kubernetes always allow containers and apps to deal with storage in the same decoupled way as other resources. Many common kinds of storage, from Amazon EBS volumes to plain old NFS shares, can be accessed via Kubernetes storage drivers, called volumes. Normally, volumes are bound to a specific pod, but a volume subtype called a “Persistent Volume” can be used for data which needs to live on independently of any pod in Kubernetes.
Sometimes these containers need to work with “secrets” which is nothing but credentials like API keys or service passwords that you don’t want hardwired in a container or stashed openly on a disk volume. While third-party solutions are available for this, like Docker secrets and HashiCorp Vault, 
In that case, Kubernetes uses its own mechanism of handling secrets. For instance, Etcd must be configured to use SSL/TLS when sending information including secrets between nodes, rather than in plaintext. 
Kubernetes apps can run in hybrid and multi-cloud environments. One of the long-standing dreams of cloud computing is to be able to run any app in any cloud or any mix of clouds public or private. 
Kubernetes’s architecture makes use of various concepts and abstractions. Some of these are variations on existing, familiar notions, but others are specific to Kubernetes.
The highest-level Kubernetes abstraction, the cluster, refers to the group of machines running Kubernetes (itself a clustered application) and the containers managed by it. A Kubernetes cluster must have a master, the system that commands and controls all the other Kubernetes machines in the cluster. A highly available Kubernetes cluster replicates the master’s facilities across multiple machines. But only one master at a time runs the job scheduler and controller-manager.
Each cluster contains Kubernetes nodes. This Kubernetes nodes might be physical machines or VMs. Again, the idea is abstraction: whatever the app is running on, Kubernetes handles deployment on that substrate. It is also possible to ensure that certain containers run only on VMs or only on bare metal.
Nodes run pods, the most basic Kubernetes objects that can be created or managed. Each pod represents a single instance of an application or running process in Kubernetes and consists of one or more containers. On the other hand Kubernetes starts, stops, and replicates all containers in a pod as a group. Pods keep the user’s attention on the application, rather than on the containers themselves. 
Pods are created and destroyed on nodes as needed to conform to the desired state specified by the user in the pod definition. Kubernetes provides an abstraction called a controller for dealing with the logistics of how pods are spun up, rolled out, and spun down. 
Controllers come in a few different flavors depending on the kind of application being managed. For instance, the recently introduced “StatefulSet” controller is used to deal with applications that need persistent state. Another kind of controller, the deployment, is used to scale an app up or down, update an app to a new version, or roll back an app to a known-good version if there’s a problem.
Because pods in Kubernetes  live and die as needed, we need a different abstraction for dealing with the application lifecycle. An application is supposed to be a persistent entity, even when the pods running the containers that comprise the application aren’t themselves persistent. 
To that end, Kubernetes provides an abstraction called a service.
A service describes how a given group of pods or other Kubernetes objects can be accessed via the network. As the Kubernetes documentation puts it, the pods that constitute the back end of an application might change, but the front end shouldn’t have to know about that or track it. Services make this possible.
A few more pieces internal to Kubernetes round out the picture. The scheduler parcels out workloads to nodes so that they’re balanced across resources and so that deployments meet the requirements of the application definitions. The controller manager ensures the state of the system—applications, workloads, etc.—matches the desired state defined in Etcd’s configuration settings.

During this course, you are going to learn all the required skills and concepts to consume from your own Laravel, PHP project, whatever service or API online.
Along this course, you are going to see how to perform requests over HTTP directly from your PHP code on Laravel. 
Use whatever method of the HTTP protocol (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE), to consume whatever service online that runs over HTTP, all of this directly from your own project with PHP and through advanced dependencies and facilities of Laravel, the PHP framework.

What are you going to learn?

Take full advantage of your tools and services (Sublime Text 3, PHP, Apache, Composer, PHP artisan, Laravel) and improve your agility and productivity to develop your projects.

What is HTTP?
HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol, which define HTTP as a protocol to transfer hypertext over the Internet. HTTP defines a set of methods/verbs and status codes to specify the way as how two points must establish a communication. 
Many programming languages provide mechanisms to perform or receive HTTP requests and, of course, PHP is one of them, including therefore Laravel.

What is an HTTP Client?In this context, an HTTP Client is a system capable of performing requests using the HTTP protocol to one or several systems or services, normally online, which one are capable of receiving requests over HTTP as well. Of course, an HTTP Client can only establish a connection with another system that works over HTTP too.
When a system performs a request over HTTP to an external service, that system becomes to an HTTP Client.
In this way whatever system, implemented in whatever language, like PHP, using whatever framework like Laravel, performs an HTTP requests becomes to an HTTP Client for any other service independently of the programming language (PHP - Laravel or not).

What is Laravel?
Laravel is the most popular PHP framework. With Laravel, you are going to be capable of developing whatever project, platform or system that you need using directly PHP and the best practices.Laravel provides many features that allow you to implement your own complex or not features in short time and easily.

It does not end here! You will have for life access; it means that you can see the new classes, versions and sections of this course at any moment during your entire life.
What are you waiting for?Be a PHP professional with Laravel and take advantage of the web data with your own HTTP Client.
See you in classes!"

You can make one for your customer that keep on asking the same questions. Or if you have a community for your fans and followers that want to know your personal details. Use your imagination, any time you have to reply the same thing over and over again, someone else like a bot can do it for you. 
In the first part of the course we’ll make a chatbot without programming skills. We’ll build a ChatBot that can answer frequently asked questions and I'll show you how to teach your bot to have any other dialogs. We'll learn this by teaching our ChatBot to make job interviews. 
We’ll use DialogFlow to process natural language, that is understand what users want. 
Chat bot will communicate to its customers via the Facebook Messenger. 
And in the second part we’ll use NodeJS to upgrade the bot. So the basic knowledge of javascript and NodeJS is needed.
With the new app our bot will be able to remember things, that is store information into a database or connect to other API services. With this bot will gain external knowledge and functionality. 
And remember, I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU. I ANSWER EVERY QUESTION AND HELP EVERY STUDENT. 
At the end of the course you’ll have a fully functional ChatBot. And you’ll also know how to teach the bot to have other dialogs with customers. You’ll know how to make a bot for yourself and for other people. 
My name is Jana Bergant and I’m a developer with over 19 years of experience. I’m an IT instructor teaching people new tech skills.  Over 11500 people are already taking my course.
I help all my students at every step of development. And I'll be here for you!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT NOTICE : Most of the course videos have been recently updated! We now use latest DialogFlow v2 in the course. Also every video with code changes has now a link to GIT commit with the changes in the video. This way you won't loose time with typing errors. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you want to catch the train in the new tech revolution, the bot revolution?
Chatbots represent one of the major trends in 2017. Some have even suggested they’ll eventually supplant our app-based ecosystem. 
App leaders like Facebook, who want to guarantee that people spend most of their time in their apps, are placing big bets on aggregating content and collecting bot integrations to keep users active and engaged.
So if the predictions turn right this will open up a new channel for businesses to reach a large audience. And here is a BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU! Be one of the first people that know how to build chatbots. You can build it for your business or other people.
This course will show you how to create a ChatBot!

Developing RESTful web services and REST API is fun. The combination of Java, Spring Boot, Spring Web MVC, Spring Web Services and JPA makes it even more fun. And its even more fun to create Microservices.
There are two parts to this course - RESTful web services and Microservices
Architectures are moving towards microservices. RESTful web services are the first step to developing great microservices. Java and Spring Boot, in combination with Spring Web MVC (also called Spring REST) makes it easy to develop RESTful web services.
In the first part of the course, you will learn the basics of RESTful web services developing resources for a social media application. You will learn to implement these resources with multiple features - versioning, exception handling, documentation (Swagger), basic authentication (Spring Security), filtering and HATEOAS. You will learn the best practices in designing RESTful web services.
In this part of the course, you will be using Spring (Dependency Management), Spring MVC (or Spring REST), Spring Boot, Spring Security (Authentication and Authorization), Spring Boot Actuator (Monitoring), Swagger (Documentation), Maven (dependencies management), Eclipse (IDE), Postman (REST Services Client) and Tomcat Embedded Web Server. We will help you set up each one of these.
In the second part of the course, you will learn the basics of Microservices. You will understand how to implement microservices using Spring Cloud.
In this part of the course, you will learn to establish communication between microservices, enable load balancing, scaling up and down of microservices. You will also learn to centralize configuration of microservices with Spring Cloud Config Server. You will implement Eureka Naming Server and Distributed tracing with Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin. You will create fault toleranct microservices with Zipkin.

★★★★★ Excellent, fabulous. The way he has prepared the material and the way he teaches is really awesome. What an effort .. Thanks a million
★★★★★ A lot of preparation work has taken place from the teacher and this is visible throughout the course.
★★★★★ This guy is fantastic. Really. Wonderful teaching skills, and goes well out of his way to make sure that everything he is doing is fully understood. This is the kind of tutorial that gets me excited to work with a framework that I may otherwise not be.
★★★★★ The best part of it is the hands-on approach which the author maintained throughout the course as he had promised at the beginning of the lecture. He explains the concepts really well and also makes sure that there is not a single line of code you type without understanding what it really does.
★★★★★ I also appreciate the mind and hands approach of teaching something and then having the student apply it. It makes everything a lot clearer for the student and uncovers issues that we will face in our project early.
★★★★★ Amazing course. Explained super difficult concepts (that I have spent hours on the internet finding a good explanation) in under 5 minutes.

Have you ever wanted to learn how to develop and host ASP.NET Web Applications in a cross-platform environment? Well you have come to the right place.
ASP.NET Core 3 (Formerly known as ASP.NET 5) is the new way to develop Cross Platform web applications in ASP.NET and C#. In this course, I will teach you how to build ASP.NET Core Web Applications from the ground up. We will also examine and demonstrate all of the features of MVC, Entity Framework Core, Web Api, Angular & C#. After we develop our ASP.NET Core Web App, I will teach you how to deploy your web app to Microsoft Azure.
What is ASP.NET Core?
ASP.NET Core is an open-source and cross-platform application framework used for developing modern cloud based web applications utilizing .NET. 
Why Build Web Applications in ASP.NET Core?
The web stack for ASP.NET is based on a older legacy platform. ASP.NET has a lot of the unused code in the .NET framework. Since ASP.NET 1.0 (Over 15 years old), there's a lot of  legacy code that has to load even when it is not being utilized in your web projects. This can cause performance issues in your web apps. ASP.NET Core  solves this issue.
ASP.NET Core is built with the needs of modern Web applications in mind. ASP.NET Core is built to be cloud-ready by introducing environment-based configuration and by providing built-in dependency injection support.
ASP.NET Core  supports cross-platform development on Windows, Mac and Linux. The ASP.NET Core (ASP.NET 5) stack is open source and encourages community contributions and engagement from developers."

Don't panic! I’m here to help. 
WCF Services are still quite often used in bigger corporations and also small teams because they might use older software that was built with these kinds of services. 
Now people with deep knowledge of WCF-Services are rare. And that’s your chance!
By the end of this “REST WCF Service for Web Applications” course, you will be able to build WCF Services from the ground up and also change existing implementations and maintain these like a pro.  

Let’s have a look at what you are going to learn in this course:

Ajax-enabled restful WCF Service with Visual Studio
Within the first 10 minutes of this course, you will already learn how to build a new restful WCF Service from the ground up. After that, we will dive deeper into the code and implement several features. For that matter, this course provides a small prepared web application - a superhero database - where all the HTML & CSS parts are already covered.
You can totally focus on implementing the WCF Service in C# in Visual Studio and call your web service from the browser with JavaScript.

The web.config
After we created a completely new WCF Service, we will go over every important file in the Visual Solution and in particular cover the Web.config. All attributes in this configurations file will be explained.

CRUD operations with custom classes and lists
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete. And this is exactly what you are going to do in this course. But you will not only use basic data types like strings and integers to implement these operations. You will use custom classes (superheroes in essence) and lists of these classes to create new heroes, update them and so on.

Common HTTP methods
To match these operations, you will make use of the four most common HTTP request methods, GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. Every HTTP method is used for a certain CRUD operation and you will learn which one you should use and why.

More than CRUD: Filtering, custom searches, sorting
A real-life WCF Service usually has to do more than just CRUD. That's we will dive even deeper and implement some custom requests like searching or sorting.

Debugging
Most likely every web service will have some errors. To find and fix these errors, it's highly recommended to debug your code. We will do exactly that. But you will not only learn how to debug your C# code but also how to debug your JavaScript code with Visual Studio as well.

Sending StatusCodes
Let's assume you're looking for a particular object but your WCF Service can't find it. Wouldn't it be great to send this information back to the requesting client, i.e. sending back a ""404 Not Found""? You learn how to do exactly that.


I'm Patrick and I will be your Instructor for this course. I’m a Web Developer for over a decade now, and I have worked for big companies with thousands of employees, small teams with only 5 people and also completely by myself as a contractor.

Are you a C#.NET developer ready to take the plunge into microservices?
Microsoft's ASP.NET Web API 2.0 for .NET Framework is an outstanding, flexible platform for creating microservices.  Unfortunately the official documentation is sparse, and you are left trying to piece together your understanding of this powerful platform by scouring the Internet for articles and examples that are often too academic, outdated, and not aligned with the practical needs of real-world services that must integrate with potentially many different kinds of clients and data center environments.
In this course, I will take you step by step through all of the layers of Web API to give you a full understanding of the platform components you will likely need to use in a modern, production-ready web service.  Examples and exercises are drawn from practical, real-world scenarios of the sort I personally faced while creating commercial web services-- and chances are you will face them too!
We'll cover all of the core Web API features like 
securing your API parameters, 
extending the Web API to perform custom processing, 
error handling, 
authentication and authorization.  
We'll look at ways to test and document your service. We'll dig into performance improvements using techniques like caching and asynchronous operations. You'll get a clear understanding of how to make your service work correctly behind application proxies such as load balancers that every commercial web service uses in the real world.
I've put together everything you need in one place to create professional, production-ready Web API services. This course will save you many hours of time and give you a much deeper understanding of everything Web API has to offer than trying to learn a piece at a time through Google-- so get a jump-start now and become the Web API expert on your team!
The Experience
The course experience is intended to feel like a more intimate, one-on-one setting.  I want you to feel like you and I are both sitting down in front of your computer, reviewing some code in Visual Studio and having a friendly discussion about how things work, the pros and cons of a technique, and practical issues you might face when you start writing your own services using the framework.
The goal is not just to learn about the details of Web API.  The examples and assignments are designed to create a web service mindset and give you of ways of thinking about the construction, performance and deployment of your web services, especially in scenarios that have unique cross-platform integration requirements.
The Tech Stack
This course specifically uses the standard .NET Framework version of Web API, which usually runs under IIS on Windows servers.  If you are using .NET Core instead of .NET Framework, then while the concepts in this course are similar, the specific syntax for .NET Core Web API is very different.  This probably isn't the course for you if you are specifically targeting .NET Core.
For testing, we'll be using Fiddler, PostMan and Swagger (via the Swashbuckle library).

 WCF 
  	               It is a framework for building service-oriented applications. Using WCF, you can send data as asynchronous messages from one service endpoint to another. A service endpoint can be part of a continuously available service hosted by IIS, or it can be a service hosted in an application. An endpoint can be a client of a service that requests data from a service endpoint. The messages can be as simple as a single character or word sent as XML, or as complex as a stream of binary data.

Why does it help for my job hunting?
Well, the answer should be straight-forward. If you have a demo web app (or several) to show case what you have done, you get much better a chance to be selected from thousands of resumes. Besides, isn't it cool to show others your web app on the go?
I heard deploying to cloud is a complicated process. Is that true?
Relatively speaking, yes. But in this course, we will use Spring Boot, which has simplified a lot of boilerplate things, to demonstrate how we can do it easily on Heroku.
What is Spring Boot?
""Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can ""just run"". We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.""  - from Spring Website
If you use Spring Boot, you will see that it's very convenient to use and under the hood it's nothing new, but Spring Framework. Checkout my other Spring Boot course in the bonus section.

Overview
When I was learning developing web applications, I would like to have a place to host those fancy apps so that I can show case what I have developed. One solution would be to use an on-premise physical server, e.g. having a desktop computer running as server at home, to host whatever apps you have developed. On the other hand, with the trend of cloud service nowadays, you can choose the cloud platform to deploy your apps, not only because those apps can be accessed from internet once deployed, but also that it's a good practice in terms of maintainability, scalability and etc. I would like to do that myself but found it difficult to do. Several reasons link to this. First, it's not that straight-forward to deploy a web app with database support on cloud platform. I wish there could be a step-by-step guide on how to do that. Second, just for show case purpose, it's not that easy to find a cloud platform without any charges.
That comes the motivation for this course. Here I just want to show you, in an easy-to-follow manner, how to deploy Spring Boot apps with MySQL database on Heroku, which is one of the most popular Cloud Service Platform today. More importantly, I will show you how to do that without any charges, which is for demonstration purpose. 
Regarding the layout of the course, we will first develop a simple hello world example using Spring Boot and deploy it to Heroku so that you can grab a feeling about it. Then, we will leverage a project I developed in another course called lagoon and deploy the backend part to Heroku. After that, I will show you how to add the MySQL database support to it. This course is easy to follow and as long as you follow the steps, you should be able to do it. Feel excited? Sign up and I'll see you in the course.

Angular by itself is an amazing framework, that together with the Angular CLI makes our life as developers simpler than ever. But imagine what it would mean if adopting this new framework would mean also that we would have to write manually our own form controls as well: such as for example date pickers, dropdowns and other commonly needed widgets.
Developing solid form controls, containers, navigation menus and modal components on top of pure Angular still requires a lot of time and effort, especially if we are looking for a consistently themed component suite with commonly needed advanced features such as for example great ergonomics, design and user experience (including animations).
The good news is that we don't have to do that anymore because together with Angular we now have available an amazing suite of Material Design components, ready to be used! And that is what this course is all about: The Angular Material component suite.
Course Overview
We will start first by scaffolding an Angular Material application for scratch from an empty folder, add it a theme and gesture support. Next, we will start exploring the Angular Material components starting with some navigation menu and icons.
The goal here is to show that its also possible to use Angular Material components also in a more incremental way, by mixing Angular Material Components with a couple of custom-made components and just some HTML/CSS. Later in this section, we will use a more advanced menu system where Angular Material is essentially taking over the whole application layout, with a side menu component.
We are then going to introduce container components such as for example Tab Containers and Material Cards, and we will show a complete example of how to use a data table with a data source, pagination and sorting. We will also show how to use Modals to edit some of data in the data table, for which we will use multiple different types of form components to build an editable form: date pickers, slider, and more.
At the end of the course, we will show we can customize the look and feel of the Angular Material component suite, by building our own custom theme.
What Will You be able to do at the End Of This Course?
You will be able to comfortably build an Angular application using Angular Material and the Angular CLI. You will be able to scaffold an application from an empty folder, and have gestures and animations working out of the box.
You will be able to setup the navigation menu of the application using the Angular Router and different types of Angular Material menus. You will be able to setup the main layout of your application using standard Angular Material container components such as Tab Containers or Cards, and use common components such as: data tables, lists, date pickers, and all sorts of form controls.
You will be able to build your own Modal dialogs, setup a custom theme and much more, and you will be able to focus your development effort on building the application core functionality itself, instead of building the infrastructure-level UI widgets, the UI design and the enhanced user experience that we get immediately out of the box with Angular Material.

We will cover everything from basic scenarios like how to set up the router in your application, declarative and programmatic navigation, to common business scenarios like implementing a Master / Detail navigation, Auxiliary Routes, Router Guards and Router Lazy Loading. 
This course includes an exercise at the end where we will build a dashboard.  
Course Detailed Overview
Single Page Applications have been around for many years now, but as we surf the Internet we rarely find them today. Why ? The main reason for that has been the difficulty of having single page apps be properly ranked by search engines.
But there are some very good news for Angular Developers, and developers of single page apps in general: the Google crawler is now much better at crawling single page applications, meaning that today its more important than ever for a developer to be able to build such type of applications. Also Single Page apps are and will likely continue to be very popular for building authenticated dashboards and enterprise applications.
The bottom line is that In the upcoming years we can expect an increase in the number of single page applications, so the goal of this course is to prepare you for that scenario by doing a step by step deep dive into the Angular Router.
What You Will Learn
This course covers the Angular Router in-depth. Its a continuously evolving course so you can expect new sections to be added as new releases are made. We are going to cover all the major routing concepts, starting at the beginning.
First we will cover how can we setup the router and avoid right off the bat some very common pitfalls that happen to developers that are just trying out the router for the first time. We are going to learn both declarative template driven routing and imperative or programmatic routing, and we are going to cover in detail child routes: when to use them and why, how do they work.
We are going to cover how the Angular Router allows us to easily implement some commonly used patterns like Master Detail. We are going to learn about the reactive features of the routers, namely we will cover the multiple parameters and query parameters observables.
We will cover the notion of route snapshot and we are going to show how routing can be the source of accidental memory leaks and how we can prevent that. The course will also cover route guards and auxiliary routes: we are going to learn exactly what are auxiliary routes but more importantly we will cover when should we use them, why and what are some common use cases.
The course finishes off with a very cool exercise where we are going to learn how we can build a widget dashboard by using the notion of auxiliary routes. With this course you can expect to get a solid foundation on the Angular router and feel confident tackling real world applications scenarios that involve the Angular Router."

Why Does Angular Need a Forms Module ?
HTML Forms seem deceivingly simple. Yet Angular Forms is one of the main core modules of the framework, and its very powerful. Why do we need a full framework module to implement something so simple as forms ? The answer is simple: forms can be some of the most complex user interfaces that a developer might have to implement.
There are simple forms of course, like for example a login and password form. But very quickly and especially in the case of dashboard development, enterprise applications, and CRUD applications we can have use cases where some very complex forms need to be implemented, spanning multiple tabs and with dialogs that edit parts of the form, all coupled with complex business logic validation rules.
Keeping track of which parts of a large form are valid and displaying to the user relevant form error messages at the right time while keeping a good user experience is a non-trivial task, that can benefit a lot from the help of a framework.
What You will Learn In This Course
In this Angular Forms tutorial you will learn how to implement both simple and complex forms in Angular, by using two different form building mechanisms: Template Driven and Reactive Forms. You will learn how to use each separately by using them to build the same form.
You will learn when to use each form type and why. You will also learn how form development can benefit tremendously from using functional reactive programming techniques, and how Angular model driven forms make that easier than ever. You will learn how the reactive forms API exposes RxJs Observables that can be leveraged to implement these functional reactive techniques.
In the end we are going to tie everything together with an exercise: we are going to build step by step a signup form which will include multi-field validation.

This course uses the Typescript language, and includes an auxiliary Ebook - The Typescript Jumpstart Ebook
We will use several MIT licensed Angular and Node packages from Auth0 (that you could use in your application), and we will also include a demo of how to use Auth0 for doing Application User Management.
Its important to realize that this is NOT an Auth0 specific course. Auth0 will be the source of a couple of open source packages we will use, and will be doing a quick demo of it to show how JWT makes it simple to delegate authentication to a third-party system, which could be developed in-house as well.
Security - A Fundamental Step in a Software Development Career
Security is probably the number one advanced topic that Software Developers are expected to master when going forward in their software development careers.
Security knowledge is hard to come by but its essential for advancing to more senior software development positions, like for example Application Architect or similar.
Learning Web Security Fundamentals, knowing how to design an application for security, and knowing how to recognize and fix security issues is an essential skill for a senior developer.
But the problem is that security knowledge is orthogonal to most other topics and it typically takes years to learn.
The good news is that once you have it, Security knowledge has a much longer shelf live than most software development knowledge in general.
Most of the vulnerabilities and fixes that you will learn in this course were useful 10 years ago, and will (very likely) still be useful 10 years from now - Angular and Node are just an example of one stack, to make the course examples more practical.
Security is seen as something really hard to master - this is actually not the case! Application Security is much more approachable than you might think, depending on how you learn it.
What Is The Best Way To Learn Security in a Fun and Practical Way?
Here is what we will do: we are going to take the skeleton of a running application that has no security yet, and we are going to secure the application step-by-step.
Using a couple of MIT packages from Auth0 (that you would be able to use in any project), we are going to implement the Sign-Up and Login functionality from scratch, and because security cannot be enforced only at the client-side, we will implement both the frontend in Angular and the backend in Node.
As we secure the application, and we are going to periodically attack the application many times during the course, to prove that the vulnerabilities are real!!
By doing so, we will learn along the way the fundamentals of Authentication and Authorization, we will become familiar with common vulnerabilities like Dictionary Attacks, CSRF and others, and we will get familiar with commonly used cryptographic tools like Hashing, Salting, JWT, password storage recommendations and more.
Please don't be intimidated by these concepts: The focus in this course will not be on the internals of each of the cryptographic tools that we will use, but instead on understanding on a high-level what problems do these tools solve, when to use each and why.
We will also learn how to design our application for security, and we will learn how in many situations application design is ou best defense.
Course Overview
We will start at the beginning: we will see the proper way of doing User Management and Sign Up: we will learn how to store passwords in a database, and we will introduce cryptographic hashes in an approachable way.
Once we have the Sign-Up functionality in place, we will implement Login and understand the need for a temporary identity token. Our first implementation will be stateful login, where the token is kept at the server level.
And at this point we could think we have authentication in place, but we decide to prepare our application for scalability, so we decide to try a JWT (JSON Web Tokens) based approach, because we know that this is what services like Firebase and Auth0 use.
We will use a couple of Auth0 packages to quickly refactor our Login to be JWT based, and learn the advantages of using JWT, and some potential disadvantages as well.
We will then see how its also possible to do Authentication using a third-party JWT-based service like Auth0, effectively removing all authentication logic from both our codebase and our database, and delegating it to a third-party service.
Note that this Auth0-specific part is only a small part of the course, and its main goal is to show how its possible at an enterprise level to delegate authentication to a centralized service, whithout having to introduce direct communication between applications and the centralized authentication service.
This means that if you can't use Auth0 at your company, you can apply the same design principles and design a JWT-solution that delegates authentication to a centralized server behind the firewall.
We will then cover how to do UI-level role-based functionality in Angular using the Angular Router, and a custom directive for showing or hiding certain parts of the UI depending on the role of the user. We will learn why the Router cannot enforce actual security.
We will also talk about server-side Authorization, and we will implement a commonly needed security-related Admin Level functionality: The Login As User service, that allows an admin to login as any user, to investigate a problem report. We can see why we would need to secure this functionality!
At the end of all these vulnerabilities and security fixes, we will have a well secured application and we will have learned a ton of security-related concepts along the way in a fun and practical way!
What Will you Learn In this Course?
With this course, you will have a rock-solid foundation on Web Application Security Fundamentals, and you will have gained the practical experience of applying those concepts by defending an application from a series of security attacks. You will have done so by actually performing many of the attacks!
You will have learned these concepts in the context of an Angular/Node application, but these concepts are applicable to any other technology stack.
You will learn what built-in mechanisms does Angular provide to defend against security problems, and what vulnerabilities it does NOT defend against and why.
You will be familiar with best practices for password storage, custom authentication service design and implementation, you will know the essentials about cryptographic hashes, be familiar with JWT and several commonly used open source Auth0 packages.
You will be familiar with the following security vulnerabilities: Dictionary attacks, identity token highjacking techniques, the browser same-origin policy, how to combine cookies with JWTs and why, Cross--Site Request Forgery or CSRF, common design vulnerabilities, and more.
You will know common practical solutions for securing both enterprise and public internet applications, such as how to use JWT to delegate authentication to a centralized service, which could be Auth0 or a in-house developed service that follows similar principles.
You will know how to implement UI-level authorization and use client-side constructs like Router guards to implement it and even build your own authorization-related UI directives.
You will also learn about server side authorization, and how to implement a commonly needed backend service that is only accessible to Admins - Login As User.
What Will You Be Able to do at the End Of This Course?
This course could help you take your development career to a more senior level, where the knowledge about web application security is essential and a key differentiating factor.
If you are a private internet business owner or thinking of launching your own platform, this course will contain most of what you need in practice to secure your own online platform in a robust and effective way.
With this course, you will have the knowledge necessary for evaluating many third-party security-related solutions, and you will know where to look for vulnerabilities in your application.
You will be able to understand most application-level vulnerability reports that come out of security audits done by third party companies, and you will be able to understand and fix the most commonly reported problems."

With Firebase, you will be able to query your database directly from the client and even directly modify data straight from the client in a secure way. You might not think that this would even be possible and that there always has to be a server involved in order for things to be secure, and that is true.
But that does not mean that you have to write the server yourself, and that is the whole point of the term Serverless. With Firebase you can write essentially serverless applications, in the sense that in the application code base there is hardly any server-side code at all when compared to a traditional REST-based application.
In this course, you are going to learn how to design and build Angular applications using a Serverless Architecture by leveraging the whole Firebase ecosystem: this includes the Firestore NoSQL DataStore database, Firebase Security Rules, Firebase Hosting, Firebase Storage and Firebase Cloud Functions.
Course Overview
This course will allow you to learn Firebase and NoSQL in a fun and practical way, as you build an application using the Firebase SDK and AngularFire. As we build the application, we will also discuss the main concepts of serverless design.
More than querying the database and displaying the data on the screen, we are going to make the application secure using Firebase Security Rules and Firebase Authentication, and we are even going to deploy it to production using Firebase Hosting.
This will all be done without writing a single line of server code! We are then going to implement a complete example of file upload using Firebase Storage, again all in a secure way and without a single line of server code.
But what if the image needs some resizing? This is better done on the server so we will implement a Firebase Cloud Function that does some image processing upon upload completion. We are also going to demonstrate how Firebase Cloud functions can be used to keep multiple parts of our database in sync using server-side trigger functions.
We are then going to talk about denormalization best practices that will help us design the database to allow multiple views of the same data.
The result is a highly maintainable real-time application with huge scalability, performance and security, written with hardly any server code at all.

If you already know Angular, and would now like to dive deeper into the Angular ecosystem and learn Angular Server-Side Rendering, then this is the right course for you!
This course uses the Typescript language, and includes an auxiliary Ebook - The Typescript Jumpstart Ebook
In this course we are going to learn Angular Universal from first principles, by taking an existing Angular single page application and converting it into an Angular Universal Application.
We will learn how to optimize our application for initial startup performance by using a fine-grained Application Shell and the State Transfer API, and we will make the application SEO (search engine optimization) and social-media friendly.
We will then deploy it to production using Firebase Cloud Functions and Firebase Hosting and see the end result!
Course Overview
We will kick-start this course by going over in detail on the advantages of using Angular Universal in our application.
After this, we will go ahead and take an existing Angular Application and using the Angular CLI we will generate an Universal bundle that will allow us to render the application on the server side.
With the Universal bundle in place, we will introduce universal rendering by writing a command line utility that will pre-render only our application root route into plain HTML.
With this in place, we will go ahead and start writing our own Angular Universal Express Server from scratch, from first principles. This option will allow us to understand in detail how universal rendering works, and it will give us a lot of flexibility.
But if we want a ready to use Express server, we can also use @nguniversal, which we will also cover. Once we have our Angular Express application up and running, we will then make it SEO and social-media friendly.
We will then apply a couple of common performance optimizations that are commonly used in Angular Universal applications: we will implement from scratch a fine-grained Application shell, and we will also reduce the number of HTTP requests that the application does at startup time by using the State Transfer API.
We will then take our fully optimized Angular Universal application and we will deploy it in production using the Firebase ecosystem: we will host the static bundle files using Firebase Hosting, and we will deploy our universal server as a Firebase Cloud Function.
What Will you Learn In this Course?
At the end of this course, you will feel comfortable taking your existing Angular Application and turning it into a server side Angular Universal application.
You will understand the benefits of server-side rendering, and you will be able to optimize your application for both search engines and social media crawlers.
You will also know how to further optimize your universal application for performance, and you will know how to deploy it to production.

The goal of this course is to give you all the tools necessary for you to be able to do your own open source Angular Library.
We will build a series of small open source libraries of progressively increasing difficulty, and we will learn a large number of Angular advanced features in a very fun and practical way.
What Is The Best Way To Learn Advanced Angular Features?The best way to learn Angular and its most advanced features is to simply take and use it to build something very concrete, like for example an application or a library - and do it in a step-by-step way, as there is no replacement for that experience.
In order to understand a technology, we really need to build something non-trivial with it - blog posts and docs will only get us so far.
This is of course very time-consuming to do without any help because we will have to learn everything by ourselves along the way as we build something, gluing together an endless number of blog posts, documentation and Stackoverflow answers.
So because of this, in order to really dive deep into Angular we will be using it to build a series of small reusable libraries. The goal is to create a practice scenario, and learn the advanced features of Angular in their original use cases, where they make the most sense and so are easier to learn.
What Libraries Will We Build In This Course?We will be building the following libraries, and learn how to publish them on NPM using the Angular Package Format: We will start by doing a Font Awesome customizable Input Box and learn the advantages of designing our components using content projection over a more input/output based design. At this stage we will also introduce the Angular Testing ecosystem.
Then we will progressively increase the difficulty of each library: we will build a dynamic tab container that allows to receive a template as a component input, effectively allowing to override parts of the component template while keeping a default look and feel for the component.
We will then build a reusable dynamic modal component with customizable content. This component have its contents configurable via either content projection or an input template, and will introduce the notion of Structural Directives.
We will also learn how directives and components of a given module can interact in a transparent way, independently of the place where they are used in the template, using a shared library service. We will then build a Input mask directive, where we will cover some advanced keyboard handling behavior.
At the end of the course, we are going to take all the components and directives that we built in previous sections, and we are going to build one larger example using them: A Payment Modal Widget!
We will then introduce the Angular Animations module, and use it to animate the modal widget, we will see how to define animations that can be reused across components.
What Will you Learn In this Course?We will learn how to create an AOT compatible library in the Angular Package Format, how to define a library module, how to isolate the styles of a component but still make them customizable, how to design components and directives to make them easier to maintain - making them customizable while at the same time giving the components great default behavior.
We will cover all of the more advanced features of Angular, including Component API Design, Component Styling best practices, Templates and Template Outlets, ng-content, ng-container, style isolation and customization, AOT, global events, debugging with the CLI, @ViewChildren, @ContentChildren, Light DOM vs Shadow DOM, @HostBinding, @HostListener, dynamic components, directives, handling keyboard events, testing, animations and more (this is a non-extensive list).
But more than presenting the features in isolation, we will use them in real use cases which will make the features much easier to learn.
What Will You Be Able to do at the End Of This Course?By the end of this course you will know many of the most advanced features of Angular, but most of all you will know when to use them and why. You will know how to build open source Angular libraries, and know how to make them available to the open source community on NPM.
With this advanced course, you will have a rock-solid foundation on Angular: you will very likely be able to tackle the more advanced Angular development tasks that you will come across in your day to day job or personal projects.

What is Your Biggest Difficulty While Learning Angular ?
RxJS and Reactive Programming can sometimes be seen as hard to get into. Although RxJs is optional in many parts of the Angular API and we can usually use Promises instead, one of the items of the Angular Project Roadmap is to allow to build reactive style applications, so clearly reactive programming is a topic that is close to the framework.
What is The Best Way To Learn RxJs ?
Why is RxJs and Reactive Programming sometimes seen as hard to get into ? The main reason for that could be that Observables and reactive programming are often presented as either a programming paradigm shift, an alternative to Promises or a generalization of functions, which are approaches that don't help as much as we could think in the learning process.
We are going to take an alternative way for learning these concepts: we are going to see that RxJs and Observables are actually a very practical and effective solution to a very common set of problems that we face all the time while building asynchronous programs like user interfaces.
We are going to see that everything around RxJs and Reactive Programming revolves around one fundamental notion: The Observable Pattern.
The Best Way To Learn RxJs
We are going to approach reactive programming as a set of application development patterns, that are an evolution of previously existing solutions. So in the first section of the course we will cover the Observable pattern as a design solution for building asynchronous applications that scale well in complexity.
We are going to cover the multiple other satellite concepts around the Observable pattern, namely the Observer and the Subject, and we are also going to learn the benefits of writing applications in Reactive style by implementing our own simplified version of an event bus.
We are then going to see why that does not scale well in complexity, after that we will refactor the application into using the Observable pattern and see how it elegantly solves many of the problems of the initial implementation.
We will also introduce the Store Pattern, see how it relates to the Observable Pattern. At the of this section we will then introduce the RxJs library, which at this point will make a lot more sense given the previous presentation of the design patterns that its based upon.
What Patterns will be covered in this course ?
With the Observable pattern and its related concepts in place and having introduced the RxJs Library, we are going to see how it can be used to build Angular Applications in Reactive Style.
We are going to cover a set of reactive patterns for both the View Layer and the Service layer, by using a set of small applications with a ready to use backend built in either Firebase or a local HTTP server. The patterns will be introduced as either implementations from scratch of a given functionality, or via step-by-step refactorings.
The pattern catalog of the second part of the course will include: Stateless Observable Services, Smart vs Presentational Components, Observable Data Services, Nested Subscribe Anti-Pattern, Data Table Pagination, Local Services, Master Detail With Cached Master Table, Error Handling Components and Services, Router Data Pre-Fetching (with Loading Indicator), Container Components, Reactive Forms Draft Pre-Save.
This section also includes a couple of related discussions concerning application design, like how to avoid Event Bubbling over the local presentational component tree, and how to use deeply nested smart components with OnPush change detection.
What Will You Be Able To Do After Taking This Course ?
After taking this course you will be comfortable with Reactive Programming, the Observable Pattern and the RxJs library.
You will be able to reason much more easily about RxJs because you now know the fundamental concepts that it bases itself upon, as well as the design intentions behind it. You will be able to find your way around the documentation and know several commonly used operators. Most of all you know how to build Angular applications in Reactive Style using the RxJs library."

In the first part of the course we are going to dive straight into the Angular Service Worker and the built-in Angular CLI PWA support. We are going to take as the starting point a plain Angular Application, and we are going to start adding PWA features on top of it in order to turn it into a Progressive Web Application.
We will start by adding the Angular Service Worker and have the Application Download & Installation feature up and running. We will learn all about Application Version Management and we will learn about the multiple caching strategies available for caching not only the application bundles, but also the application data.
We will then add an Application Shell using the Angular CLI and Angular Universal, and make the application One-Click Installable using an App Manifest. Finally we will add Push Notifications to the application using the Angular Service Worker, for a complete mobile-like PWA experience.
This Course In a Nutshell - Part 2 - Service Workers Fundamentals
In this second part, you will learn about Progressive Web Applications in general (including Service Workers, App Manifest, and the Cache Storage API.), and you will use these APIs to implement several native-like features: One-Click Install, Offline support, application download and installation, application data caching and more.
We will also learn Service Worker Web Fundamentals from first principles using built-in browser APIs directly and we will confirm our understanding of what is going on in every step of the way using the PWA built-in Chrome Dev Tools.
The knowledge learned on this section has a long shelf live, as its about browser fundamentals and how the new PWA Web works in general, so everything learned here is still applicable to any other development platform other than Angular.
Why PWAs? Build the Future Of the Web Today
The future of the Web is clearly going in one direction: Progressive Web Applications! With the upcoming Safari support and the ability to install a PWA directly to a Windows desktop, PWAs are the new generation of web applications that will bridge the gap towards Native Apps: this will even include in the near future things like Bluetooth and Payments.
PWAs look and feel like native apps, but there is no App Store and all its issues involved: instead a web application can now be installed directly to the user desktop or home screen with one single click!
The application will then install itself immediately on the background, so that it does not have to be downloaded again unless a new version is available.
The application will feel blazing fast in a way that until now only native apps could: A PWA is offline, background sync and notification capable.
PWAs are not mobile-specific: any application can benefit from starting up an order of magnitude faster! The Angular CLI PWA support and the Angular Service Worker take PWA features to another level: we will be able to add PWA features reliably to our application in a transparent way via the Angular CLI, as part of the production build process.
But we will still need to understand how PWA features work under the hood, in order to troubleshoot any issues, interact with the Angular Service Worker or configure the Angular CLI.
Course Overview
In part 1, we are going to take PWA features one at a time.These features where designed to be used together, so using them to implement a concrete use case is the best way to learn them. The main component of a PWA is a Service Worker, so that is our starting point.
We are going to learn all about the Service Worker lifecycle, how multiple versions of the service worker are handled by the browser, and we will learn multiple Service worker installation and activation GOTCHAs. We are then going to build a service worker that gives to an application the ability of showing an offline page when the network is down, using the Cache API.
Most of the PWA APIs are Promise-based, so to make the code more readable we are going to be using Async / Await in our examples. We are then going to implement Application Download and Installation: we are going to see how we can use a Service Worker to completely download a version of the website into a user's mobile or desktop, and how to handle the installation of multiple versions of the application.
We are going to demo the performance benefits of caching the complete application locally by simulating a slow network, and learn how to clean previous versions of an application. We will also learn how to cache UI-specific data and derived View Model data on the client side using Indexed DB and a Service Worker, and we will also earn how to implement Background Sync.
The next section of the course will cover all about the App Manifest and how to configure that one-click installation experience that we are looking for. After that, we will inspect our application with the Lighthouse tool and analyze the generated report.
The last part of this PWA fundamentals section will cover Web Push and Notifications. In this section, we are going to setup a node server with Web Push capabilities, and then we are going to link it to our service worker in order to implement mobile-like Notifications.
What Will you Learn In this Course?
You will learn how the PWA Browser features work in general, not only in the context of an Angular application. You will know how to analyze and troubleshoot PWAs using the Chrome PWA Dev Tools. You will also learn how to leverage the Angular Service Worker, and all the Angular CLI PWA features to build PWA-enabled web applications.
What Will You be able to do at the End Of This Course?
You will be able to design, develop and troubleshoot PWAs, plus you will know how to quickly add PWA features to an Angular Application leveraging the Angular CLI and the Angular Service Worker.

Script for Angular/JS
Angular JavaScript, commonly styled as AngularJS, is basically another JavaScript framework like React, Ember, and jQuery (mostly considered as a library). A Google employee, Misko Hevery, created and developed this framework. Compared to other JS frameworks, AngularJS is supported by Google. 

  
For the uninitiated, frameworks like Angular add more functionality to JavaScript and HTML. Their primary purpose is to make it easier for people to create scripts and robust web pages. In addition, they reduce the lines of codes you need to write in order to achieve a certain goal.

  
To take advantage of Angular JS, you just need to include it in your page and use its numerous modules, expressions, filters, directives, and controller. To learn how to use them, you must have knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

  
Why Should You Take This Course?
First, if you are taking web development as a career, it is a must that you know two or three JavaScript frameworks. Also, take note that the three most common frameworks required by employer nowadays are jQuery, React, and Angular.

  
Second, Angular is fully backed by Google. You can expect that it will be continually developed and used for a long time. And that guarantees that the demand for people who know Angular will be always be high. Learning it will be a good investment of your time.

  
Third, it is also useful in creating apps, Single Page Applications or SPAs to be precise. The Web has become a huge platform for creating and using programs. The Internet is not only used for browsing information anymore, but it has become a place where things, primarily computing, can be done, too.

  
Fourth, MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js) stack is getting too popular. For you to become a very competitive developer, you do not need to get stuck only knowing the common stacks like LAMP and WAMP. 

  
Fifth, it is just too easy to learn as long as you have a decent background in HTML and JavaScript. To be frank, learning Angular is just like learning HTML5. You will be mostly adding new “attributes” in your HTML arsenal — of course, Angular is not limited to that.

  
The Advantages of Angular JS
As mentioned, one of the biggest strengths of Angular JS is the creation of Single Page Applications. Frameworks like Angular make it easier and faster to develop an application or scripts. You do not need to start from scratch. All the common functions and modules are already made for you, and all you need to do is integrate it in your code.

  
Another strength of Angular is the ease of modular development. Angular provides a better implementation when it comes to modules. If you have code that you will use over and over again, you can just turn it into a module and just call it whenever you want.

  
Code made in Angular JS is more readable, organized, and structured. If you are going to work with a team, those traits will make the work easier for you and your coworkers.

Adding fitting styles and animations to a web page tremendously improves the user experience!
It's more than a little bonus - animations and styles help the user understand the flow of your page, pass on feedback to the user and overall improve the usability of your page.
This course teaches you which tools Angular gives you to dynamically style and animate your web page. This is not a CSS basics course - this course will really dive into the rich toolset Angular ships with, allowing you to build a reactive, user-friendly web application.
Just think about your favorite web apps: How many of these look ugly, seem to be styled randomly (and statically) and use no animations? Probably not that many - time to join the club of developers creating awesome user experiences!

That's how this course is built, with the goal to help you both learn and understand AngularJS.  
 Note: In this course you'll also get downloadable source code. You will often be provided with 'starter' code, giving you the base for you to start writing your code, and 'finished' code to compare your code to."

In this update we addressed the major changes in the Angular version 7.1.1 release (late November 2018).  Per our course content, including hands-on coding exercises, there were a few breaking changes in the 7.0.x releases which ripped across much of the original project code and also included minor, non-breaking changes which outdated certain aspects of our original content.    

We updated all of the course’s code-along video content to fix the breaking changes, including:
Angular-CLI & npm syntax usage
Angular-CLI template output changes
Material 2 inclusion and configuration syntax changes

Fallout of the above deltas outdated a large percentage of the course’s existing content.  Each affected video in the series was updated to reflect the current release.

The Angular CLI has been continually improving since its inception.  Additional features that have bumped its power up changed some of the commands and flags that are used in creating new Angular projects, generating assets, and adding schematics.  

While closely tied to the Angular core library, but not included in it, the Material 2 styling library has endured a lengthy, rough development and release lifecycle.  As this library is so closely tied to the Angular core, we’ve included content in this video series from the beginning.  Again, in this current release, many breaking changes and previously unavailable features were included.  We made significant changes to existing content and created additional content to appropriately cover the current state of the Material library.

As with prior updates to this video series, we applied incremental improvements  to existing content in an effort to continuously improve the overall effectiveness and appeal of the entire course. 

Keeping Current with Angular
This course will be updated regularly to reflect the constant changes in the Angular framework. We're teaching this course in a modular style rather than project-based style so that small changes in Angular can be updated right away, and not affect your ability to learn in any way.

Hear what my students have to say
Absolutely fantastic tutorial series. I cannot thank you enough. The quality is first class and your presentational skills are second to none. Keep up this excellent work. You really rock!﻿ - Paul Whitehouse
The instructor, Max, is very enthusiastic and engaging. He does a great job of explaining what he's doing and why rather than having students just mimic his coding. Max was also very responsive to questions. I would recommend this course and any others that he offers. Thanks, Max!
As a person new to both JavaScript and Angular 2 I found this course extremely helpful because Max does a great job of explaining all the important concepts behind the code. Max has a great teaching ability to focus on what his audience needs to understand.
This Course uses TypeScript
TypeScript is the main language used by the official Angular team and the language you'll mostly see in Angular tutorials. It's a superset to JavaScript and makes writing Angular apps really easy. Using it ensures, that you will have the best possible preparation for creating Angular apps. Check out the free videos for more information.
TypeScript knowledge is, however, not required - basic JavaScript knowledge is enough.
Why Angular?
Angular is the next big deal. Being the successor of the overwhelmingly successful Angular.js framework it’s bound to shape the future of frontend development in a similar way. The powerful features and capabilities of Angular allow you to create complex, customizable, modern, responsive and user friendly web applications.
Angular 7 simply is the latest version of the Angular framework and simply an update to Angular 2.
Angular is faster than Angular 1 and offers a much more flexible and modular development approach. After taking this course you’ll be able to fully take advantage of all those features and start developing awesome applications immediately.
Due to the drastic differences between Angular 1 and Angular (=Angular 7) you don’t need to know anything about Angular.js to be able to benefit from this course and build your futures projects with Angular.
Get a very deep understanding of how to create Angular applications
This course will teach you all the fundamentals about modules, directives, components, databinding, routing, HTTP access and much more!

(note: this course includes the Typescript Jumpstart E-Book)
One of the most pervasive problems that we will come across as frontend developers are state management issues. These tend to show up eventually in larger applications where we have multiples components that need at the same time display and modify the same shared data, in different points of the component tree.
In these situations, it's not possible for only one component to load and own a reference to the data, because that data is needed in other parts of the application that the component is not directly linked to.
We would like our view layer to simply update itself automatically whenever the common shared data gets updated by any of the components that are consuming it, without having to create dependencies between those components or calling the server again just to get the latest data and update the view.
Besides the problem of sharing common editable data between components, we want to give our users the best possible experience. We want the application to work as fast as possible, minimizing the need for continuously showing loading indicators to the user, especially if it's only to keep loading the exact same data from the server over and over again due to router navigation.
This leads to another problem to consider: in an application with a large number of users we would like to minimize the number of API requests that the application makes, in order to allow it to scale more effectively.
Reducing the number of API requests is also important if our application is built on top of a Pay as You Go platform like Firebase or Amazon AWS, where the billing is done per bandwidth consumed.
These design problems are fundamental to UI design and pervasive, but the good news is that all of these are very common architectural problems can be solved in one go using a very elegant architectural solution: the centralized store design.
Course Overview
In this course, we are going to cover in-depth the most commonly used Angular implementation of the centralized store design: we are going to cover the Ngrx Angular Reactive Extensions library ecosystem.
Ngrx is a set of related libraries that together provide a complete solution for implementing a store solution in Angular. We are going to cover Ngrx Store, which contains the reactive store system similar to Redux which is the heart of the store solution.
We are also going to cover Ngrx Effects in-depth, which is a fundamental part of the store architecture as well. We will cover Ngrx Entity which is a practical solution for storing collections in the store.
We will also show how to setup step-by-step the Ngrx DevTools, including the Router Store module, and we will scaffold a good part of our store solution using Ngrx Schematics and the Angular CLI.
What Will You Learn In this Course?
By taking this course you will become comfortable with the centralized store solution in general, and with the Angular Ngrx implementation of that design in particular.
You will feel comfortable designing new Application features using the store design, using a simple methodology and you will know in-depth the complete Ngrx library ecosystem: including Ngrx Store, Effects, and Entity libraries.
You will know how to quickly scaffold parts of the solution using Ngrx Schematics, and how to set up the Ngrx DevTools from scratch, including the router integration."

What is Angular-CLI?
Angular-CLI is a command line interface for Angular 2 and it's recommended by the official angular 2 team.
Here is a quote from Angular 2 Official Website
""Good tools make application development quicker and easier to maintain than if you did everything by hand.""

A big part of the problem is a lack of resources and limited understanding of how to integrate these 2 awesome technologies, Angular on the front-end and ASP.Net Core on the back-end.
The big problem, is that the industry has always tried to simplify the solution by compartmentalizing the technologies. But knowing how to integrate technologies is the key to performance, and making an application easy to maintain. This mean you must have a good understanding of the backend technologies, the development environment, as well as the frontend technologies.
Why do you think Microsoft seems behind in the integration of Angular on the front-end? Hmm… Could it be that the newer technologies have us dropping down to the command line? Why do we need to drop down to the command line anyway? Could it be the only way to be compatible across multiple platforms? Are there Microsoft developers that like to drop down to the command line? Can I do my complete development, without dropping down to the command line? Watch this course, and I will show you how!"

Look at some reviews of my students: 
Really he knows what features we want also his performance in Q & A section was so fast. I was shocked. his teaching style is like a real. I highly recommend to the new user who wants to learn all the combination such as react node and angular. also, one more thing he tries to give the response out of this framework such as if you get stuck in javascript, react native and so on. you won't be regret after purchasing his course. I guaranteed 100%.

I took this course because the MERN stack project presented in the previews looked much more in depth and had way more features compared to other courses and projects I have seen before. This course has not disappointed so far. His use of the Google Maps API, HOC's, Authentication, etc for the course project are some of the coolest features and best code I have seen written for MERN in a while. My constructive feedback for this course is that the way the Instructor explains the basics of React, Redux, HOC's in the beginning are too fast paced and do not provide enough detail. This was not an issue for me as I am well versed in React already, and simply wanted to IMPROVE my React skills rather than relearn the basics. The instructor is passionate, responds quickly to questions, and is continually adding new features such as Image Uploads for the project which I am super excited for. I will definitely be keeping an eye out for future content by this instructor. TLDR: This course is great for increasing your React Skills and creating an Awesome MERN Project. However, if you are trying to learn the basics of React, I would suggest other courses.

Very good and interesting course, I as a beginner I did not have any problem to start programming without problems! a man jumps into it, and it is a fascinating and seductive beautifully illustrated. I'm still in the middle yet, but I can not wait for another lesson! For me nicely done! keep up with good work :)

Mosh has a fantastic teaching style, and just delivered the best online course I've seen in a long time. Mosh's approach to teaching and guiding makes no assumptions on existing Angular 1.x knowledge, but helps those who have to clarify new concepts. Mosh guides you through critical concepts slowly without skipping over details, and the course is extremely worth investing a few hours in, your understanding of Angular 2 will reach new levels. He fills all the gaps, presents impeccably well and the preparation was top notch, seriously can't recommend the course enough.

The fact is, learning how to program in C is not only an excellent programming language to get started with, but it will also make you a better programming in other computer languages!
Why learn C ?
C is often considered to be the mother of all languages because so many other languages have been based on it.
Though C is simple it is one of the most powerful languages ever created.  Considering it was created over 40 years ago, it is still used heavily and is usually in the top 5 or 10 most popular and most widely programming languages in the world.
Learning C can actually make you a better programming in other languages like C++, Java, or C# by equipping you with a mental model of what the computer is actually doing when you run your programs.By learning how things really work ""under the hood"", and understand memory space, CPU architecture and so on, you can create more efficient programs, and obtain a huge advantage over other programmers in the process.
If you want to become a better developer, learning C is a great way to start!
Why enrolling in this course is the best decision you can make.
By the end of this course, you will understand the fundamentals of the C Programming Language, and make yourself more marketable for entry level programming positions.

You will be in a position to apply for real-time programming positions, and truly understand the core language that most modern languages are based on!
If you have previously used the C programming language, then this course will deepen your understanding of it. If you have never used it, no problem, you will see that it can help you become a more efficient C developer.
The course will be constantly refined in the future based on student feedback!
This course does not skip on the details.  You will learn how to write high quality code and become an excellent problem solver.  This course does not just present how to code in the C programming language, but, also includes all the details on ""why"" you are doing the things you are doing.  At the end of this course, you will fully understand the concepts of the C Programming language.

Start programming with this simple and straightforward guide through the most basic programming language.
Understand quickly one of the most important skills in programming
In the programming industry you might come across the idea that you have to learn the most advanced, cutting-edge and fully featured language right off the bat. This might be a good idea for some people, but, for most, it's a wise choice to start from the beginning, the root of all programming language, the C language.
Who uses this language? Essentialy, everybody, whether they know it or not. It's used in your operating system (mobile and desktop), for most embedded systems and even in building other programming languages (like Java, Python and C#) 
Content of this course
This course has been created with you, the beginner, in mind. We start from the basics of the basics, how to create the code in the C programming language and run it. We will be using Dev-C++ as our IDE but this is just a recommendation, if you have already other IDE installed you can certainly use that.
We will continue with creating an overview of what a program actually is and how we can interact with this program using user input (from the keyboard) and program output (using the command prompt's console). We will also learn ways to format our output however we want.
Interacting with the program is all nice and good, but what if we want it to do something else based on a certain condition. This is what will learn next, and we won't stop there. We will also go through ways in which we can do something (inside our code) however many times we want.
Next up we'll cover ways to manipulate text in a low-level manner. This is very interesting and much more in-depth than in some other languages. This is something that is hidden from you when using other languages (such as Java) for text manipulation and will be great food for thought for the curious.
And lastly, we will shortly cover how to create code that can be used later on using functions.
After this course you will be on your way to becoming a programmer. You will know the basics which can be applied in any programming language and much more."

Many modern programming languages owe their syntax to C. C is still a very popular programming language after over 40 years. C++ is based on C, but extends the language with features such as function templates, namespaces, and (of course) classes.
In this course, we'll explore the C and C++ programming language. We'll start with data types of C, then quickly dispel the mystery (and fright) that surrounds C's most powerful element, the pointer. Understanding pointers first allows us to grasp the underlying nature of arrays and structs, parameters passed by reference, and many other things hidden by other languages but exposed in C.
Then we will move to streams in C++ , which simplify input and output a great deal.
Here's a brief list of what you'll learn:

Most cars, IoT devices or embedded devices have their software written in this kind of developing language. 
For developers just getting started, think of this as the primer to help kickstart your career.
C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of the C language. It is therefore possible to code C++ in a ""C style"" or ""object-oriented style."" In certain scenarios, it can be coded in either way and is thus an effective example of a hybrid language.  
C++ is considered to be an intermediate-level language, as it encapsulates both high- and low-level language features. Initially, the language was called ""C with classes"" as it had all the properties of the C language with an additional concept of ""classes."" However, it was renamed C++ in 1983."

Why learn C you may ask?
For such an old language, it is still one of the most powerful tool any aspiring programmer could have in their toolbox today. It opens your eyes to many lower level processes taking place in your computer.
C is what I like to call a ""wild"" language, it gives 100% freedom to programmers unlike many modern programming languages. 
We can see the effect C has on many modern languages like Java, C++, Objective-C, C# by observing their syntax. It has paved the way for making a global standard amongst the future languages.
How Low can we go?
C is a much lower level language compared to  other languages like Java i.e it gives you the freedom to perform certain operations that would normally be restricted by other programming languages. After the assembly language, C follows next.
How would this course help you?
Leave the horrifying stories you've heard about programming in C, this course would take you from a noob to an expert C programmer providing you with the tools you'll need to succeed in every aspect of fundamental programming.
Motive/Goal
We break the core concepts of advanced topics in C such as pointer and memory management. We'll also look into common errors such as segmentation faults and bus errors–Ones that are very challenging and hard to find. Using this way of teaching you'll be up and ready to become very fluent at writing code in C.
The course is fully supported by the course instructor, you can be sure to get a quick response/feedback to all your questions."

When anyone start a journey to programming life; C, C++ and java are must to learn languages. We have named this beginners programming bundle as MegaPrimer.  
  	What am I going to get from this MegaPrimer?  
 Complete C programming Course:  
 C programming is the root or foundation for any person who wants to master computer programming. Learning C in a comprehensive manner is very essential for every software interested soul but things can only be interesting when words are not jargon and every piece of code is explained in detailed manner and that’s what this course is all about.  
 Complete C++ programming Course: 
  	C++ is an Object oriented programming language that can be used to create modern desktop software, game development or even critical system drivers too. You will find out that most trading applications are designed in C++ because in trading speed is money. When we get into the game development, c++ programming is hard to avoid if you want to create a fantastic and popular game.  
  	In this entire c++ video series, we start from installing gcc on our system. After gcc, we will install Eclipse which is a cross platform IDE because most efficient programmers don’t develop things on notepad. And yes, we don’t like to talk about here and there so expect pure c++ programming guide with everything explained code by code and that too practically.  
 Complete Java programming Course: 
 Java is the most popular, powerful and highest job oriented programming language so far. Consulting, not just one or two, in fact any top survey for “Job oriented market for programmers”, you will find that java is always there in top 3 position. After the implementation of java in android projects, a new job market got opened up. Java is diverse enough to build Mobile applications, android application, Desktop application or even Web application. "

In case if you don't know what C is then let me tell you it is a computer language in which the codes of the computer are written. Through these codes, the programmer makes websites and web pages. There are various concepts that are taught in these videos so as to clear all the doubts of the students in the field of C computer language.
These videos are designed in such a way that all the concepts are explained in the easiest possible way. The various complicated concepts of C are explained in depth in these videos. The videos start from explaining the basic concepts and at last explains all the concepts with examples. 
The concepts that are covered under these videos are such as
 Arrays,
 functions, 
pointers and 
strings. 
These concepts are sometimes difficult to understand for the beginners. Therefore much attention is paid to these concepts so that the student is able to understand the concepts to the core. This course is :
Not only for newbies but also for the front-end developers.. 
People with basic knowledge would benefit a lot from these videos as they would be able to revise their concepts first and then learn complicated once later. 
Every genre of learner would be able to learn deeply as well as thoroughly.
 
If you want to learn from the ground level and reach the heights then I refer these videos to you. This series would take you the level zero to the top. You would be able to make your own codes with new features. Your enhanced knowledge would help you to shine in your field. By learning from these videos you would realize that learning was never this much easy.

The easiest and most comprehensive way to learn and master C programming at your own pace. This course will not only teach you to master C language from the ground up, but it will also make you understand why we do things the way we do them in our code and what's the best way to write efficient, simple and elegant code!. 
You will learn everything from programming fundamentals all the way to the most complex parts like pointers, memory management, string manipulation,File IO and much more!
C is one of the most important of all programming languages. It is used to program desktop applications, compilers, tools and utilities and even hardware devices. The C language is fast and efficient – but it can be hard to learn. Unless you use this course. This course begins with a gentle introduction to C but quickly moves on to explain some of its most confusing features: everything from C's 'scoping' rules to the curious connection between arrays and memory addresses. By the end of the course you will have a deep understanding both of the C language itself and also of the underlying 'architecture' of your computer.
In this course, we'll explore the C programming language from the ground up. We'll begin with a brief section on computer basics followed by a Hello world program in C and a walk-through to understand its elements and to dissect it. 
You will be introduced to the main elements of C like data types, operators, arrays, strings, pointers...etc. We will cover ALL C KEYWORDS in this course, when and how to use them with coding examples!
I have dedicated entire sections for pointers, arrays and strings. This course has the most extensive details on how an why we need pointers and how to avid pointer related gotchas. I guarantee you will not find any other course that covers pointers in this depth with easy to understand and follow examples like this course.

If you want to become a professional software developer then search no more, you have found the right course!
Why learn C?
C has been around for over 30 years and it is not going anywhere. Chances are you're going to run into code already written in C or you may need to interface with code that was written in C whether you're programming in C++, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Javascript, C# or VB.NET

  
C Knowledge is important as it exposes you more to the hardware and you learn how memory works which helps you write more efficient and more optimized code

  
C makes you a better Java, Python, Ruby or even C# programmer.

  
C is also good for game development for performance reasons as well as OS level programming

  
C code is portable, so you can write cross-platform applications once you master it 

  
Even though I chose Visual Studio on Windows to teach you C programming, the concepts and ideas you learn here are portable and can be applied to any other platform, IDE or OS with little or no effort at all.

  
Why Visual Studio?

I think Visual Studio is one of the best IDEs for programmers and I have dedicated several lectures especially to mastering Visual Studio and I share many tips and tricks that will help you customize it and get comfortable with it in no time!

Dennis Ritchie developed the C language and it has known as the mother of programming languages. It has nearly been four decades since C programming language invention and yet it is in use in many applications today. The invention of the C language made the usage of languages like COBOL, PASCAL, and FORTAN obsolete. The C language is widely in use today. Many other programming languages have their programming structure evolved from the C language just like the C++ and C# programming languages. The C language is very robust and it could be used to implement many programs, software and applications. Any person who is interested in learning programming should first make sure that he/she has a strong basic background in C programming language. A person who masters the varied aspects of the C programming language can master any other programming language with relative ease.

The third course, Optimizing Selenium Test Performance, covers benefits and advantages of Selenium 3.0. Focus on the most common performance bottlenecks and how to work round them through optimization and parallelization. You'll finish the course with the use of Selenium Grid and Sauce Labs for limitless parallelization and other goodies.

  
The fourth course, Dive into Core of Selenium Automation, covers boosting the performance and reliability of your automated checks by mastering Selenium WebDriver. Produce the right feedback when failing and what the common exceptions are, explain them properly (including the root cause), and fix them. You’ll also see the differences between the three available implicit waits and explicit waits, and learn to work with effective page objects. Moving on, the video shows you how to utilize the advanced user interactions API, how you can run any JavaScript you need through Selenium. Finally, the video discusses hard assertions and soft assertions and how to use them.

  
The fifth course, Advanced Selenium Automation, covers delving into the world of advanced Selenium automation.

Oracle is currently the most popular relational database management system in the world. It is used by thousands of big companies who are usually willing to pay good salaries to the right people, which includes those with practical Oracle SQL knowledge that is based on best practices and experience.                     
Most SQL courses give you theoretical SQL knowledge. In this course you will learn by actually writing code.
In spite of what you might have heard, relational databases are not going away anytime soon, and the demand for good Oracle SQL developers will continue on the rise.
Learn Oracle SQL in a practical and smart way and jump-start your career:
Understand the most basic concepts about relational databases and Oracle.
Learn how to read, filter and sort information from database tables.
Learn how to use comparison, logical, set and other type of operators in Oracle SQL.
Learn how to use numeric, text, date, conversion, aggregate, analytic and other types of Oracle SQL functions.
Learn how to add, modify and delete information from Oracle databases using SQL.
Learn how to use SQL to create and use tables, constraints, sequences, indexes and views.
Get tips and knowledge that is usually only learned through years of SQL experience.
Much more.

 Oracle  implementation of SQL is very powerful. Learn it and use it smartly and stand out from the crowd.
I created this course because although there are many courses about Oracle SQL available on different platforms and in different formats, most of them, if not all, focus too much on “telling” or “demonstrating” how to do things, but don’t give you, as a student, the opportunity to test and practice what is being taught. Some of them tell you to practice or to do things along the instructor, but unfortunately, such approach doesn’t really work. Seeing how things are done or just copying or repeating what you see on the screen is not going to help you learn SQL. You might feel that you are learning, but when the time comes for you to write a command on your own, you are most likely not going to feel very confident.
In addition to that, most SQL courses, if not all, teach you the same kind of content you would find in a text book, but, what about those things that are not part of the “official” curriculum and are only learned through experience?
The goal of this course is to help you learn Oracle SQL in a way that can make you stand out from the crowd. I really want you to learn and shine, and at the same time contribute with my grain of sand to bring more talented people to the IT industry.
Content and Overview:
This course was designed with beginners in mind, but if you have some previous SQL knowledge you will still learn a lot.  After setting the learning environment, it starts with the most basic concepts about databases in general and a very short introduction to Oracle and the SQL language.
You will start learning about the simplest SQL statements and before you even notice it, you will be gradually progressing to more advanced concepts.
It does not include demonstration lectures because the whole course is a coding demonstration. In 90% of the video lectures you will be watching my computer screen while I type, explain and run Oracle SQL code.
It does not include labs at the end of each section because practically every lesson has a coding task for you to practice what you are learning.
Please note that PL/SQL (Oracle's procedural language) is not covered in this course. 
You are hiring me to teach you Oracle SQL, and that is what I am going to do, and I will do my best to help you learn in a way that can really make you stand out from the crowd of thousands of people who start learning SQL every day.
I will not only teach you SQL. I will share my years of Oracle experience with you through what I call “experience tips”. Those tips can really help you differentiate.
And you don’t even need to have a computer on which you can install Oracle software to take the course. I will show you how you can watch the whole course and do practically all the coding exercises from your browser, without needing to install anything, if that is what you need or want.
Oracle SQL is very powerful, and you are about to start learning it!
 You could be being seen as an experienced and knowledgeable SQL developer by your friends, peers and potential employers in a very short time, but you have to take action. If you want my help, you’ve got it."

Anyhow if you want to do this here is some helpful tips
Firstly download the latest stable version of Python. Next download and install the cx_Oracle extension, from Oracle official website. You will then need to download and install the Oracle Client ensuring you select the version specific to your installation ie. 10g or 11g etc. You can get the download from here Oracle software downloads.
Make sure that you have the ORACLE_HOME variable set and the bin is in your PATH variable, otherwise you will get cx_Oracle DLL load failure messages.
If you have a fairly, long complex SQL statement then encase the query within triple single quotes. It works a treat and takes care of new lines without need for you to do any formatting or
string manipulation. Lets Start
Note : This Course explicitly for working with CSV, Python and Oracle . 

Good Luck !!!

It is an internationally standard language used to communicate with various databases for data manipulation.  SQL is vital for data analysis .
In this beginners course we will be using analytic functions to perform data analysis from an Oracle database .
Analytic functions compute an aggregate value based on a group of rows. They differ from aggregate functions in that they return multiple rows for each group. The group of rows is called a window and is defined by the analytic clause. For each row, a sliding window of rows is defined. The window determines the range of rows used to perform the calculations for the current row. Window sizes can be based on either a physical number of rows or a logical interval such as time.
Analytic functions are commonly used to compute cumulative, moving, centred, and reporting aggregates.In this course we learn the syntax used to write analytic functions which includes the use of Partition By andOrder By.
The analytic functions we will use for our data analysis include:
    • Dense Rank Function    • Rank Function     • First and Last Function     •  LAG Function     • LEAD Function     • LISTAGG Functions    • ROW Number Functions     • Windowing Clause 
    Using analytic functions for data analysis can help provide answers to business solutions :
    •   Who are the top ten sales-reps in each region?    •   How many employees in an organization    •   How many employees earn less than 45K in an organization    •   How many new employees joined the company in the past 18 months    •   What goods are flying off the supermarket shelves and so on..

Procure to Pay process which is also known as P2P cycle is followed by any organization in any ERP system if they would like purchase any products (it could raw materials, office supplies, infrastructure etc). Of course when there is a purchase there should be a payment.  This entire process of purchasing a product and making payment for that product to supplier is called procure to pay process.
Procure to Pay Life Cycle is one of the important Process in Oracle Applications R12. Procure to Pay means Procuring Raw Materials required to manufacture the final or finished Goods from a Supplier to Paying the Supplier from whom the material was purchased. But this process is not just two steps. It involves many steps. Let’s see the steps and Oracle Application R12 involved in performing those steps."

Standard Purchase Orders:
You generally create standard purchase orders for one-time purchase of various items. You create standard purchase orders when you know the details of the goods or services you require, estimated costs, quantities, delivery schedules, and accounting distributions.
Blanket Purchase Agreements:
You create blanket purchase agreements when you know the detail of the goods or services you plan to buy from a specific supplier in a period, but you do not yet know the detail of your delivery schedules. In this case you create and use blanket purchase agreements to specify negotiated prices for your items before actually purchasing them.
Contract Purchase Agreements:
You create contract purchase agreements with your suppliers to agree on specific terms and conditions without indicating the goods and services that you will be purchasing. You can later issue standard purchase orders referencing your contract.
Planned Purchase Order:
You create a planned purchase order when you want to establish a long term agreement with a single source supplier with a commitment to buy goods or services. Planned purchase orders include tentative delivery schedules and accounting distributions."

TableViews allow us to show a list of items to the user. We can see this in the Music app, the Settings app, Twitter, Facebook, and almost every app on our phones. This course will teach you the basics of TableViews, which are essential to making iOS apps in a fun-filled and engaging way.
We’ll also help you to strengthen your Swift skills along the way.
We’ll dive into the topics of arrays, loops, and functions. We’ll show how arrays are immensely helpful when working with TableViews and are the backbone for displaying data. We’ll also learn how loops help us harness Swift to do an insane amount of processing that we as humans could never do. We’ll also cover functions which allow us to organize our code and make it more efficient.
Then we bring it all together in an Emoji Dictionary app. This app lists a bunch of emojis that we find interesting.
When a user taps on an emoji, we’ll then show the emoji magnified to see all details. We’ll also provide a definition of the emoji to the user. This course will help you learn some awesome iOS techniques.
By the end of the video course, you’ll know how to build simple iOS apps using the TableView structure and also know the intermediate swift programming language.
About the Author
Nick Walter is an iOS developer who has been focused on mobile app design and creation for over 5 years. His involvement in the iOS community started off with a bang, and in 2013 he was one of the 25 students worldwide to be invited to Apple's ""Cocoa Camp."" Within the community, he is also co-president of an Apple developer group called ""Cocoa Heads.”
He always wanted to transform brand new ideas into reality, but growing up in a small town, he had limited access to the required programming resources. This led to his early interest in online education. After experimenting with various companies, learning styles, and teaching processes, he adopted the best strategies and applied them while creating his courses.
Since the announcement of the new Swift programming language by Apple, he devoted himself to the Apple documentation and any online resource that was available. Prior to teaching the internet's first course on Swift, he created five iOS apps from scratch that are currently live in the App Store and are being used by thousands of users worldwide."

In this course we are going to build a platform for Real Estate. The platform can be easily modified for any product categories. Cars, clothes, toys, you name it.
We will build the application from the scratch and upload it to Appstore when we are done.
The business plan of the platform will be as follows:
There will be 2 types of users: Agents and Buyers.
Agents will have to buy subscription to the app to be able to post properties. This group will be the one that will spend money and bring profit for the app. We will use in-app purchase for this, you can decide on subscription plan, like one off, or monthly etc.
Agents will be able to post unlimited number of properties for sale on the platform.
Buyers (free subscription) will be able to post 1 property only in for sale section, and search the listings, contact the agent to view or purchase the property.
Guests that didn’t register will be able to use the app to search their desired properties, but they won’t be able to contact the Agents to arrange viewing or buying the property. Also, they cannot post any properties in for sale section.
This is done to get more users to register for the app. Also, Buyer can update to Agent at any time after registration.
 
We will use phone number verification for the app users to login/register. I will also show you how to make email address verification in case if you want to use it as well.
I will teach you all you need for the development. if you have any previous experience in iOS development, it will help you. Doesnt matter if you are beginner or advanced iOS developer, you will learn a lot from this course. 
We will look into different backend and choose the best option for the different tasks.

In iOS 12 Bootcamp we are going to teach you how to become an iOS developer in few weeks. This course is designed for absolute beginners as well as intermediate developers. If you want to learn how to Develop iOS Apps, you have come to the right place.
Our complete iOS12 BootCamp teaches you how to code using Swift 4.2 and build iOS 12 apps. Even if you have ZERO programming experience, this course is for you!
We are going to start from ZERO level and gradually learn the basics of the Swift programming language and building apps in xCode. First we are going to learn the theory and then use the things we learn in a project so you can practice the new material in a simple applications that we will do together.
As you learn more and more the course will gradually become more advanced where we are going to build more advanced apps. 
By the end of this course, you will be fluently programming in Swift 4.2 and be ready to write iOS applications by you own and start a freelancing job as an iOS 12 developer.
We are going to have many challenges in the course and I am going to provide you with a lot of reading material as well.
But remember the if you want to become developer, you have to actually type the code yourself. This is the best way of learning to code. You may read 100 books on iOS Development, but if you never type the code, you will not learn how to code.
From beginner to iOS 12 app developer with just one course!
This course will cover all the parts of iOS and Swift development you will need.
Also, in this course i will spend quite a lot of time on errors and debugging the problems. This is one of the most important areas of the software development. If you cannot debug and find the problems in your code, you will never become a developer. So this is very important aspect of the course. We will cover some of the basic most common errors in the beginning of the course and then dive dipper when we learn more and more about Swift.
So by the end of the course, you'll completely understand:
Concepts of Object Oriented Programming and Model View Controller: The type system, variables, functions and methods, inheritance, classes and protocols.
Data Structures, how to work with collections, arrays and dictionaries.
Software Design, how to organise and format code for readability
Networking, how to make asynchronous API calls, store and retrieve data from the cloud, and use the JSON format for server communication.
Machine Learning, how to make artificially intelligent apps using iOS 12's new CoreML framework.
Core Data, Realm, UserDefaults and other ways of persistent data storage.

This course is best suited for beginner programmers or mobile developers planning to move on to Xamarin and cross platform development.  
Throughout the course, we will cover a wide range of topics such as interface design in Xamarin, dynamic outlet creation, game logic and user interactions. I have included all of the assets that we use in this series and also I make my own project available to you at the end of each lesson. 
This course is meant to act as an introductory Xamarin C# learning experience. By the end of the course, you should be able to develop a variety of interfaces and games logic and you should have gained an intermediate understanding of various methods for handling touch events. This should take you no longer tan 4 hours in total and I guess you should be able to finish it in one afternoon. 
I should mention that while this course is a beginner level, it does NOT cover matters such as basic programming concepts. It assumes you have some familiarity with the basics of a programming language. If you wish to start with this course and don't have any programming background, you should prepare yourself to spend a little longer to understand and follow through the lessons.
I wish you the best throughout your development and if you had any issues, please drop me a line.

Create Stunning Apps for Apple with Ease
Build your own Apps from the Ground Up
 
This course will teach you everything you need to know to get started with creating Apple apps for iOS 9. It has been designed for students who are already familiar with programming structures and the software development process, and who have an interest in applying this to iOS applications.  
With over 57 lectures and 6.5 hours of content, you'll go through the entire app building process from planning and design right up to publishing your app in the iTunes App Store. Starting with an overview of becoming an iOS developer and Apple's developer centre, you'll then progress to building the user interface of your app. This includes storyboards, controls, navigation and more. Following that, you'll move on to specific iOS features like posting to social media, geocoding, and son on, before getting to grips with the data side of things. Finally, you'll cover how to publish your app. 
By the end of this course, you'll be well on your way to becoming a fully fledged Apple developer, and you'll have all of the knowledge and experience necessary to create flawless, fun, and fully functioning apps for the Apple community.  
 
Tools Used
Xcode: Xcode is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that contains all the software you need to create beautiful, fast, and easy to use applications for Apple devices like iPhones and iPads. You can experiment with new APIs, add additional source code, and even make use of he interface testing feature, which records your app in action.
Swift: Swift is one of the newest programming languages to hit the scene and was especially developed for iOS and OS X (i.e Apple products). Swift is one of the most simple languages to get a handle on, and what's even better is that it makes creating lighting-fast, fun and interactive apps easy. "

In this course, you will learn how to create a backend system for your iOS apps using Firebase.
We'll begin first by learning about CocoaPods. CocoaPods allow us to bring other people's code into our project. We will need this in order to get Firebase code into our project. Then we will start the course project: creating a simple version of SnapChat. Doing this will allow us to learn the ins and outs of Firebase.
After installing Firebase, you'll move on to learn how to build our social network one step at a time. First, you'll master user account creation and user authentication. Then you'll create snaps to send to other users. Throughout all this, you'll learn about Firebase's database, storage, and authentication system.

 apps are dull and bland. In this course, you’ll not only learn to work 
with image files, but also how to access the camera on iOS devices to 
allow users to take pictures.
You’ll start by learning the fundamentals of working with images in 
Xcode. You’ll see how to import images and properly lay them out in your
 app storyboard files. Then you’ll learn how to access hardware on iOS 
devices to allow users to take images and save them.
We then bring everything together by creating a Collector app. This 
app allows a user to take an image of something, give it a proper name, 
and then use this as a database to reference the collection. This will 
reinforce what you previously learned and apply it to a fully functional
 practical app that uses Core Data to save images.

SQL can be used for Data Analysis to transform data already present in the database to valuable useful information that help companies and organisations make key business and management decisions.
Everywhere data is being collected, every transaction, every web page visit,every payment—all these and much, much more are filling relational databases with raw data that can be analysed to provide useful information.
There is a demand for people who can use  data to perform reporting and analysis thus helping businesses and organizations make important and critical decisions.

_________________________________________________________________________
Here Is Everything You Will Learn In This Complete Course:
The Complete Course is divided into 12 Major sections
Section 1: HTML5.
Section 2: CSS.
Section 3: Building A Portfolio Site.
Section 4: Bootstrap 4.
Section 5: Building A News Portal.
Section 6: JavaScript.
Section 7: ES6.
Section 8: Git & Github.
Section 9: VueJs.
Section 10: NodeJs.
Section 11: PostgreSQL.
Section 12: Final Project:Medical Inventory Management Web App.
First we start off by learning the basics of Web Development and installing the required tools to write HTML5 code. In this section we cover almost all the HTML5 concepts and learn how to layout the structure of HTML elements on the webpage.
In the next section we learn the basics of CSS which will help us make our site look appealing. We will learn how we can add CSS to your existing HTML pages to make them more visually attractive. We will also learn about CSS flex box which will help us to make responsive layouts.
Now as we know HTML & CSS, its now time to build something from the skills we have acquired. In this section we will build a portfolio site with HTML & CSS which will list all your skills. 
Moving along we now start learning Bootstrap 4, a CSS framework which enables us to build fully mobile responsive websites in no time. Bootstrap 4 will make your development speed 2X as faster as you no longer have to build components from scratch. Bootstrap has hundreds of built in components which we can use to build websites quickly and without any hassle. We will learn about the Bootstrap grid system and learn how to make responsive layouts with it. 
Once we master Bootstrap 4, its now time to build a fully mobile responsive news portal. In this section we will build a news portal which will work and look great on all of the devices like a computer, tablet and a smartphone. The best part about this news portal is that its completely built using Bootstrap and its components. Meaning we have not used a single line of CSS code to style the elements.
The next section is all about JavaScript which is the most popular language for front end web development. We will start off by learning the basics of how JavaScript can be used in the browser to make websites more interactive. We will learn data types, functions, global and local scope, loops, exceptions and all of the other basics related to javaScript. At the end of this section, we also build a simple interest calculator using JavaScript and Bootstrap. 
Then we learn about ES6 or ECMAScript6 which is the latest version of JavaScript. We will learn some of the most relevant and new features of ES6 like the let and the const keywords.
 We then move towards learning Git & Github which is one of the most popular tools amongst web developers across the globe. We will start by learning what is Git and how Git can be used for version control. We will learn about all the important commands required to work with Git all with a practical example. Later we start learning GitHub and learn how GitHub can be used to collaborate with teams while working on a project. 
In the next section we learn about VueJS which is a progressive front end framework which helps us to build user interface components in an efficient way. VueJs is now being used by a lot of tech companies and is much easier to learn as compared to other similar frameworks like React. Many developers prefer VueJs over React because of its learning curve and the extensive documentation available online. In this section we will cover all the important aspects of VueJs.
Once we finish learning the front end technologies, its now time to start learning about the backend. 
We now start learning about NodeJS which is a JavaScript runtime which allows us to run JavaScript on the server. NodeJS is extremely powerful and it allows us to configure server, connect to database, make queries and a lot more can be done using Node. In this section we will start learning Node right from the basics and we will build our very own server. We will also learn about the node package manager and learn how it can be used to install and use different node packages which are used to extend the functionality of our apps.
 Now once we know how about Node, we now need a database to be able to store and manage our data at the backend. Hence we move on to learn about Postgres which is a database used and trusted by large software companies. We will learn about PostgreSQL which is a structured query language used to query the Postgres database. We will learn how to create our very own database from scratch and how to setup the structure to store and manage our data.
In the final section we apply everything we have learned in the entire course by building a fully functional medical inventory web application.   
This will be a complex database oriented application which will store data into the Postgres database and allow us to insert, update, delete and modify medicine records from the front end. We will learn how to build a complete web app from scratch right from building the database, configuring our server to building the front end.

With five minutes, allow me to explain why.

This is the course that I needed before becoming a software engineer
This is the course that I needed before becoming a full-time software engineer, working downtown in San Francisco. It teaches the concepts that I put into practice every day. It's crucial to understand the entire full-stack.
But while I was self-learning, covering every layer full-stack was like searching for distant fragments of a huge puzzle. All the resources were spread out. They were all in different locations.
I needed it all in one place. I needed it to be all in one project. That is the purpose of this course.
This course is the selected highlights of months (years actually) of research. Of reading hundreds of coding articles. Of listening to tech talks. Of building projects at hackathons. Of studying computer science in college. Of working on projects as a software engineer.
All in one place. In one all-encompassing project.

Feature-focused, like the Industry
The project in this course mirrors projects that you would work on in the industry.
I also structured the project development to mirror how apps are built in the industry. You will evolve your full-stack project, just like how projects in the real world grow. You will be feature-focused.
You’ll build the project one feature at a time - continually improving the software and shipping to the users.  This is distinct from other courses that are architecture-focused. Meaning, you won’t build the entire backend, and then move on to the entire frontend. Instead, each new feature will involve every aspect of the full-stack architecture.

The DragonStack Project
What is the DragonStack Project?
The Dragonstack Project is a multi-account collector’s application for gathering dragons. You can trade, purchase, and breed your dragons! By selling dragons, you earn currency. Or if another account uses your dragon for its mating services, you also get currency. Each dragon has unique traits, and belongs to a specific generation.
This app is different. It's not a Facebook, nor Twitter clone. Now, the core of the architecture is the same. Behind those larger apps like Facebook and Twitter, are the concepts you'll learn in this course. But you'll use those concepts to create something unique. If you're already investing the time to learn the full stack, I want you to make something no else has made before. That way, you'll learn how to apply these concepts to innovate.

From Scratch
In this course, you will build everything from scratch. You will take over every layer of the full-stack. You won’t use any separate APIs for the features.
1. You’ll build the API. Sure, you can learn about web requests by consuming a public API. But in order to fully learn how these web requests APIs work, you need to build one yourself. 
2. You'll be in full control over the database. You won't rely on a library to do manage the database for you. You won't treat the database like magic. No, you'll have full control, and generate the SQL yourself.
3. You'll build the authentication system. Authentication is an easy step to skip while learning. Don't. It's a critical concept to understand. 99% of the applications you make, or work on, will have an account base.
This from scratch is the core philosophy of the course. In addition to building the APIs from scratch, you’ll create the full backend. This will include the server, and core database files. Plus, you’ll build the full frontend, with the modern and very widely used React library.

The Full Picture Grounded with a Conceptual Understanding
As you work with new technologies, it is essential that you see the full picture. Therefore, in this course, you will learn more than just how to code in Node.js, PostgreSQL, React, and Redux. On top of that, you will gain an understanding of the design, models, and ideas behind these technologies. You’ll learn exactly how companies apply these technologies to their problems. With a foundational understanding of the concepts, you will be able to see how each layer fits together in the full-stack

Practical Experience
Just because this course places a large emphasis on concepts, does not mean you won’t dive into the code as soon as possible. This course also focuses on practical experience. After all, the concepts are only reinforced when you actually apply them and build the software!
By the end of the course, you’ll have so much experience working with the technologies. I have no doubt that you’ll be able to confidently add Node.js, PostgreSQL, React, and Redux to your resume. Plus, you’ll have an impressive full-stack project in your portfolio to prove it.
Not to mention, you can do many of the final course challenges to make your course project the most unique and advanced one around.

Course Challenges
Littered throughout the course are challenges. This is not the kind of course where you’ll be blindly following along the entire time. These challenges will give you the chance to implement the next feature yourself - reinforcing your knowledge, guided by your own experience.
As mentioned, there is also a list of final course challenges. These go beyond the scope of the course. But these are the ones that will make your project truly stand out.

Simplicity
On top of teaching full-stack web development and its core technologies, the overarching emphasis of this course is building code with simplicity. No matter what technology we code in, we will ensure to design our classes and build our functions in a simple way.
Now simple does not mean easy. Easy means to lie near. Just because something is easy and immediate does not mean it's right. Sometimes, the easy solution is actually a shortcut that will require even more work to fix later.
Our definition of simplicity is singularity. Simplicity in this course means to be one-fold. As much as possible, we will make our functions simple, one-fold, and singular in purpose. We don’t want our functions to have an overwhelming number of side effects that introduce unneeded complexity into our application.

Scalability
Simplicity is the prerequisite to scalability. Because you'll code the functions in a simple  way, you will find that you’ll be able to quickly add new features to the application. The upfront cost of carving out the most simple design pays huge dividends for scalability.

Progress in Dragonstack
Your progress with the dragonstack project will follow an exponential curve. Throughout the course, graphs will show your progress on this course. There will be an initial ramp-up period. However, once you make it past the hump, your pace will skyrocket. Stay determined to get that momentum going. It's one of the best feelings when you're riding that freeway of productivity.

Redux Broken Down
Redux can be a very complex concept to handle with frontend development and React. This course boils down Redux, and explains it a low level. We won’t look at Redux as some magic library that just solves all of our state problems. No, this course is going to fully dive into Redux. We’ll experiment with its functions, examine its parameters, and even consider the overall design decisions of the library.
Promises!
JavaScript Promises that is! Promises will play a huge role in the backend of this course. So if you were looking for a good excuse to learn how JavaScript promises work, then this is the perfect project for you! I promise…
Names
This course might spend more time than others discussing names. Some may say variable naming is arbitrary: “just give something a short and clear name and be done with it...” To that, I wholeheartedly disagree! Naming is one of the most important parts of software. Getting the name right can be the sole difference between smoothly flowing through understanding a codebase, and spending minutes or even hours trying to understand how functions work together.
Timely Delivery
Since Udemy allows students to speed up lectures, I’ll talk through the lectures in a timely manner that will be understandable at all speeds. Change the speed as you wish.

Kafka Connect is a tool for scalable and reliable streaming data between Apache Kafka and other data systems. Apache Kafka Connect is a common framework for Apache Kafka producers and consumers. 

  
Apache Kafka Connect offers an API, Runtime, and REST Service to enable developers to define connectors that move large data sets into and out of Apache Kafka in real time. It inherits strong concepts such as fault-tolerance and elasticity thanks to being an extension of Apache Kafka. Kafka Connect can ingest entire databases, collect metrics, gather logs from all your application servers into Apache Kafka topics, making the data available for stream processing with low latency. 

  
Kafka Connect standardises integration of other data systems with Apache Kafka, simplifying connector development, deployment, and management.

  
In this course, we are going to learn the Kafka Connector deployment, configuration and management with hands-on exercises. We are also going to see the distributed and standalone modes to scale up to a large, centrally managed service supporting an entire organisation or scale down to development, testing, and small production deployments. The REST interface to submit and manage connectors to your Kafka Connect cluster via an easy to use REST API’s.

  
Students Loved this course – Students have rated the course with 5 stars...!!
Tin Pavlinic says “This course is an excellent resource for those getting started with Apache Kafka-Connect. Stephane explains concepts very clearly and provides plenty of practical examples. The setup is easy. You can follow the examples along on your own machine, and then experiment further. I highly recommend this Apache Kafka course.” ★★★★★

Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. Analytic functions compute an aggregate value based on a set of values, and, unlike aggregate functions, can return multiple rows for each set of values. 
If you want to run a query using only aggregate functions, the query will return one row with a column for each field. If you want to run a query using an aggregate function in conjunction with the GROUP BY function, the query will return one row for each value found in the grouped field.
If you want to run a query using an analytic function, the query will return one row for each field in the defined range of fields used to perform the calculations.If you use an aggregate function with any other function in a query, one field in the query must contain the GROUP BY function. 
Analytic functions are frequently used in fields such as finance and science to provide trend, outlier, and bucketed analysis for large data sets
Unlike traditional aggregation functions, which return only a single value for each group defined in the query, Analytic functions return a single value for each input row .They increase the efficiency and reduce the complexity of queries that analyse partitions (windows) of a data set.
This course will use aggregate and analytic functions to query and analyse data from a PostgreSQL database."

IT professionals can never reach the expected level of success without a strong foundation in software development and software testing concepts. Also, it has not been easy to find project oriented and real-time training in software testing fundamentals. However, we all need to learn the basics of quality assurance and testing before jumping into any sort of automation. In this course, we took a hands-on and step by step approach to make it easier for IT professionals to master software testing core concepts. This course includes basic and advanced QA training videos with practical examples of different aspects of testing including software development life cycle (SDLC), overview of specific roles and real-time work environment for a software tester, different types of testing, creating comprehensive test plans, and test cases.

Knowing how to write good test cases is extremely important for you as a testing resource and believe you me, it doesn’t take too much of your effort and time to write effective test scripts! You just need to follow certain guidelines while writing test cases or as they call it – follow “test case writing best practices.”
In this article, I am going to talk about some simple yet effective tips which you could use for writing effective test cases.
Test case writing is an activity which has a great impact on the testing phase and this makes test cases an important part of the test execution process!
So, writing test cases which are effective as well as reusable is very important; good test cases save a lot of time in the later stages of testing (really!) if you do it right in the first attempt…
Effective Test Cases writing is a skill and you can acquire it only with practice and in-depth understanding of the application for which test cases are being written.
Incorporating some simple tips I have given here will help you master the skill of test case writing."

The SOAP approach requires writing or using a provided server program (to serve data) and a client program (to request data).
REST sits on this stack in a way that makes it easy for humans to understand what's being exchanged while allowing computers to talk to one another efficiently. You may have also heard of some of the other technologies that can reside here, such as SOAP (which requires a fair amount of data and computing power and is not really appropriate  for the constrained resources of mobile applications), JMS (which is specific to Java applications) and XML-RPC (which has many of the same problems as SOAP without any of the benefits of standardisation).

Code doesn’t always perform as expected and, with complex applications, it’s very easy to break code with minor changes. Unit tests and test-driven-development exist to help us manage expectations of our functionality and to ensure that other developers working on our code are aware when a change they made affects already existing functionality. This is very important when working on large projects with many collaborators as well as small projects with few developers.  
  	    We’ll be pre-writing tests in code that we can run whenever we make updates to our application. This will ensure that no new logic breaks old logic, and that we are certain that our programs are executing properly when given different inputs.

Nowadays the gaps between app releases become smaller. That means that the test effort grows. Normally, all functionalities of an app have to be tested manually by a tester before every release. But with a short release cycle it is almost impossible because there are other projects that have to be tested. To solve this problem there are automated tests. With automated tests you can test functionalities after every bigger code change or before a release. We can run these tests automatically in the background so we don’t waste so much time on manual testing.
In this course we will write tests for our shared code. At first we create unit tests where we test single functionalities of an example app. In the integration test section we will involve other components in our tests like the database. There we need to create a good test environment to add new tests fast and easy.
It doesn’t matter if you use Xamarin Forms or the Xamarin native approach. This course is intended to test the shared code of a Xamarin app."

Many assume the time that would be spent static testing would be better spent on design or coding. They are correct that static testing is time consuming, can be costly, and that it requires complete buy-in from the management team. While not always easy, static testing is not nearly as costly as fixing the defects introduced by skipping this important step. 
	Please remember this formula which you will not find anywhere on Google: 
Static testing > Better Documentation > Better Code > Fewer Defects > Faster Delivery > Higher Quality > Happier Customers 
	Introduced right after the requirements gathering phase, 	 static testing is crucial if you want to reduce the number of defects introduced to the system or application under test. After this course you will be able to use your own static testing methodology that can be implemented at any organization. You'll leverage QA Mentor's proprietary checklists to validate and verify every single artifact in the Software Development Life Cycle. You'll also learn how to easily show your management the potential Return on Investment (ROI) before the process begins, and then show them exact ROI afterwards. And believe me, they will be shocked on how much money you will save the company! 
	You should know that the cost of a defect found during traditional testing is about 10-20x the cost of one found in static testing. That may seem exaggerated, but here's why that's true. It takes longer to fix a defect once it's been coded into a functioning system. Finding the defect may take hours of a tester's time, then additional hours to fix the defect that could involve more than one developer or DBA. Next, the fix must be verified by a tester once more. All totaled, a defect found during traditional testing can take 5 – 20 hours (or more) to fix and verify. Contrast that with finding that same defect in static testing. Fixing it requires no code changes and only takes 30 – 60 minutes, sometimes even less so the difference in cost is dramatic. 
	In this 	 10 video lecture e-learning course, you will learn how to implement a 	 static testing phase within your Software Development Life Cycle. You will learn how to start application testing before a single line of code is written and identify issues that would potentially be converted into functional defects if not detected in the Static Testing Phase. You'll learn the entire methodology behind inspection methods and static testing on business requirements, functional requirements, design documentations, prototypes, wireframes, use cases, etc. At the end of this course you will test your knowledge by taking 40 questions test. 
	As part of this course you will receive 	 4 complimentary static testing checklists which you can use to inspect and validate Use Cases, Functional Requirements, Prototype and Code Reviews. Also as a bonus you will have a direct interaction with 	 CEO of QA Mentor Ruslan Desyatnikov by asking any questions relating to course material via email. 
	You'll learn the principal of shift-left testing, something few companies fully understand or are willing to invest in, and how to calculate ROI on static testing and impress your senior management. Find out how 	 QA Mentor's CEO Ruslan Desyatnikov was able to save one company over 10 million dollars using these principals and methods by stopping design and development of multi-year platform while using static testing techniques. These are only a few of the many things you will learn that are based on real, hands-on experience instead of just textbook theories. Ruslan Desyatnikov is eager to share his secrets of Static Testing, gleaned from nearly 20 years of active QA experience implementing static testing in companies such as HSBC, Citi, Sterling, Sterling and several other fortune 100 companies. Invest in yourself and your future! You will be glad that you did.

Learn how to unit test your PHP code using the PHPUnit testing framework.
Learn what unit tests are
Learn how to write unit tests using PHPUnit
Build a test suite for PHP functions and classes
Make test methods dependent on each other
Use test doubles: mocks and stubs
Learn how and why you should use dependency injection
Learn test-driven development (TDD)
Learn how to test protected and private methods and properties (and whether you actually should or not!)
Learn how to test abstract classes
A skill that will enable you to write higher quality code, in a shorter time, with better documentation and fewer bugs.
Learning how to write unit tests for your code will make you write better code. With automated tests, you can find bugs more easily, and if you break something you'll notice straight away.
Many experienced developers write unit tests for their code. It's a repeatable way of checking that the code works as intended, and also serves as documentation. Many popular PHP projects are unit tested, such as WordPress and Moodle, and if you use frameworks such as Laravel or Symfony, these provide tight integration with the PHPUnit testing framework.
Content and Overview
How do you currently test your code? Maybe you run your code in a browser, use var_dump a lot and so on. The problem with this is that you only tend to test new code - you don't go back and test old code. What if you add some new code that breaks the old code?
With automated unit tests, you have more control. If your new code breaks something, you'll notice straight away. You can fix bugs more easily, thereby reducing development time.
Tests are also a form of documentation, just like comments: they serve to show why the code has been written that way. 
Suitable for all PHP developers, you'll start by learning the basics of unit testing PHP code, including how to use assertions.
Then you'll learn how to test functions and classes, and how to configure the PHPUnit framework.
Next you'll learn how to use test dependencies, fixtures and how to test for exceptions.
You'll also see how test doubles work - mock objects and stub methods.
Then you'll learn how to write code using test-driven development - writing the tests first, then the code.
You'll also learn how to test protected and private class methods and properties, and whether this is actually a good idea or not.
When you complete the course you'll be able to write unit tests for your existing PHP code, and develop new code using test-driven development.
Complete with all the code shown in the lectures, you'll be able to work alongside the instructor and will receive a verifiable certificate of completion upon finishing the course.
Also, at all times throughout the course you have access to the instructor in the Q&A section to ask for help with any topic related to the course.
Enrol now and add unit testing to your PHP skillset!"

The participants will be also provided with the CP-SAT Mock Exam solutions so that they can evaluate their performance. Special webinars will be conducted for participants who register for the CP-SAT Exam. If you wish to register for exam please mail to cpsatsupport@ataevents.org or visit www.agiletestingalliance.org,"What is CP-SAT?


CP-SAT stands for “Certified Professional – Selenium Automation Testing” certification prepared and honored by “Agile Testing Alliance” & “University Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)”. CP-SAT is the only global accepted certification exam which has practical assessment. 

Having basic knowledge of Java Programming and Manual Testing is the only prerequisite for this training.
The course is applicable for all roles and not just “testers”. Knowledge, experience & certification is consciously designed to focus on “agile testing” and not on “agile testers”.

The course covers IDE (older IDE), this was also a part of the syllabus earlier. Now it is not. You can directly start from the WebDriver section if you want to skip this entirely.
RC is also for older versions of Selenium and may be relevant to those who are still maintaining legacy scripts and are still using RC. This is also not part of the latest CP-SAT syllabus.

How is it useful?      
CP-SAT is designed to train agile professionals with the basics of testing web applications using Selenium leading to advanced topics. You can build, enhance, and maintain scripts in the Eclipse IDE Editor and port Selenese scripts to execution in RC and Selenium 2.x (WebDriver). The training is combination of theory as well as hands-on execution of scripts using the features of Selenium with ample time given to practice until you have mastered the concepts. The Selenium IDE plug-in builds effective and resilient test scripts using a wide variety of current programming languages. The focus is on the practical application of Selenium to resolve common web automated testing challenges. This course focuses on Selenium IDE with RC/Selenium 2.x configuration and execution related concepts using JUnit and TestNG. There is an extensive coverage on Selenium Reporting mechanism, Data Driven Testing, getting started Grid concepts, Continuous Integration (CI) with Jenkins/Ant.

Am I Eligible?      
Anyone having basic experience Java programming and manual testing can go for this certification.

In this course I will show you that you can write maintainable and stable automation scripts very quickly. And Sahi will help us with this.
Unlike Selenium, where you must download web drivers for each browser, Sahi solve this problem easily. Maintenance of test infrastructure will be handled by properly selected web automation tool - Sahi.
Let me shortly depict what you will learn in this course.

  
Prior automating web application with Selenium, Sahi or other dedicated tool, you need to understand why and what to automate. 
After that, you will install and configure web automation tool Sahi which allows to write highly effective multi browser automated scripts.

  
Then, you will learn how to identify any UI element. Selenium uses XPaths for complicated HTML code whereas Sahi has its built-in API which makes constructing locators easier. 
Also, we will learn how to perform a wide range of possible actions and assertions.

  
Finally, we will learn how to improve our tests and enhance their maintainability using Page Object Model and Data Driven Testing.

  
Selenium with TestNG or xUnit provides us with DDT but Sahi has its extremely simple implementation.
We will learn how to organize our tests into test suite and execute a lot of test scripts within one run. While Selenium with TestNG requires complicated XML files, Sahi implements suites as a simple list of tests you want to run!
At the end of my course, as a bonus, I will present you complicated things in simple way: how to download and upload files, how to read and write files. These tasks may be quite challenging in other technologies like Selenium with Java.

  
I am sure this course will very useful for you. And I guess you will think about migration your tests from popular technologies like Selenium, Protractor or others :-) 
Welcome to my course!

Which programming language can you learn that when added to your resume,  will often get you a job interview?  C++ 
Which programming language is routinely ranked in the top 5 
programming languages by popularity, and been consistently in the top 10
 for close to 20 years?  C++
Why you should learn C++
Much, if not most of software written today is still written in C++ and this has been the case for many, many years. 
Not only is C++ popular, it is also a very relevant language. If you 
go to GitHub you will see that there are a huge number of active C++ 
repositories and C++ is also extremely active on stack overflow.
There are many, many leading software titles written entirely or 
partly in C++. These include the Windows, Linux and Mac OSX operating 
systems!
Many of the Adobe products such as Photoshop and Illustrator,  the 
mySQL and MongoDB database engines, and many many more are written in 
C++.
Leading tech companies use C++ for many of their products and 
internal research and development. These include Amazon, Apple, 
Microsoft, PayPal, Google, Facebook, Oracle and many more.
Can you see how learning C++ will open up more career opportunities for you?
If
 more professional companies are using C++, it stands to reason that 
there is going to be more of a demand for C++ programmers.
But the main reason programmers should probably learn C++  is because it is so powerful!
What do I mean by powerful?
C++ is super fast,  and is a general purpose programming 
language that supports both procedure and object oriented programming 
making it very flexible.
It can scale easily. And it can be portable as well.
C++ can do many things that other languages just can't.
That's why nearly every major language has a way to interface with code written in C++.
Since C++ has influenced so many languages, if you know C++ you'll likely see elements from C++ in new languages you learn.
How can a beginner learn C++ ?

Find a good course, taught by an instructor with many years of 
experience in C++ is critical, as is the need for the instructor to have
 the necessary skills to be able to teach you the language.
Frank Mitropolous, the instructor in this course has been using C++ 
for over 2 decades and has taught students in both university courses 
and industry training courses.  He even worked on a C++ compiler 
development project while he was in industry.
So not only will you be learning C++ from an expert C++ programmer, 
but you'll also be taught by an instructor who has successfully 
taught at university level for many years.
As a result, you can 
take this course with confidence, knowing that you will learn C++ the 
right way, and in the shortest possible timeframe.
Which version of C++ should I learn?
C++ has  had many version releases and updates over the years.  It's a
 sad fact that most C++ courses do not teach Modern C++, but focus on 
old, obsolete versions of C++.
Frank teaches you Modern C++ (specifically C++ 11 and C++ 14).  
Learn C++ the right way, with Modern C++, as taught by Frank in this course.
Is C++ difficult to learn?
With all the power and flexibility of C++ comes complexity.
There is no question that C++ is one of the most complex programming languages out there.
But with the right instructor, and the right training, you really 
can get up to speed with C++ quickly, and that's what this course is all
 about."

This course offers a comprehensive overview of the RSpec testing library for the Ruby programming library. RSpec is the most popular Ruby Gem of all time, with over 300 million downloads to date.
If you're new to the topic, testing is the practice of ""writing code that confirms that other code works as expected"". Tests control for regressions, which are changes to the code that break the program. 
The benefits of testing extend outside of the codebase. Adopting a test-driven approach will also make you a better developer. Tests force you to think critically about the program and its features: the classes, the objects, the methods and more.
Testing Ruby with RSpec begins with the essentials and proceeds to more complex topics including:
Installation
Project Initialization
Test-Driven Development (TDD)
let variables
before and after Hooks
Subjects
Shared Examples
Shared Context
Built-in Matchers
Mocks and Doubles
Instance Doubles
Class Doubles
As a software engineer and consultant who's worked with Ruby for several years, I'm excited to introduce you to the awesome RSpec library, its elegant syntax, and all of its fun quirks.
Thanks for checking out the course!"

Testing is the difference! Effective tests enable you to add features quickly, refactor your code without fear, and ship new releases without big new bugs.
Make Your Project Successful by Writing Meaningful Tests
Python Testing with Green
Tests are just a way of writing code that uses your project and makes sure that it really does what you think it does!  We'll learn the best way to write tests and some common problems and pitfalls that you should avoid.  
This course is designed as a practical reference for Python programmers who have real code that they would like to start testing, or test more effectively. I provide real runnable examples that you can type in yourself or download from the resources section.
The beginner section requires zero prior testing knowledge.  I teach the fundamental basics of testing Python code including how to run your tests the ""traditional"" way as well as with the high-performance Green test runner.  After completing this section, you will be able to write tests and run them.
The intermediate section teaches you how to write meaningful tests, and covers every aspect of the Python ""unittest"" module that you will use in daily life.  Upon completing this section, you will know more than most Python programmers about how to test your code.
In the advanced section I go over how to mock unit tests, integration testing, advanced usage of the Green test runner, and some tips and tricks for getting the most out of your testing.  Only an elite few gain this level of knowledge on their own.  After completing this section, you will be a master of Python testing."

We will go through everything from the simplest JavaScript function to ES6 classes & private code testing. We will also learn how to test your code coverage, so you always know where you stand.
One of the goals of this course is to teach you how to think about unit testing, and not simply teach you the basic syntax or how to call an assertion.
We will go through most scenarios you will run into day to day, as well as address a number of issues and examples ignored by most unit testing courses available online.
You should have some node experience, you don't need to be an expert, but you should at least know the basics.

Testing automation doesn't have to be painful. Software testing is an essential skill for any developer, and I'm here to help you truly understand all types of test automation with Python.
I'm Jose, software engineer and founder of Teclado. The focus of this course is on testing for the web—we'll be working with REST APIs and web applications, and technologies such as unittest, Postman, and Selenium WebDriver.
What will you work with?
This course is jam packed with all the latest technologies for you to use professionally and in personal projects:
Fundamental Software Testing Skills
We will cover every fundamental software testing skill that you need to know in order to get a job testing or to apply these skills in your existing projects.
From things like mocking and patching using the unittest library, which reduce dependencies and turn complex tests to simple ones; to looking at all types of testing: simple unit tests to large system tests and even customer acceptance tests.
The Testing Pyramid
The Testing Pyramid says you should have a lot of unit tests, slightly fewer integration tests, even fewer system tests, and as few acceptance tests as possible.
Throughout the program we work on this concept, making sure that we have full coverage of every component of our system with unit tests. Then we test the dependencies using integration tests. Finally, we cover the entire system and its assumptions using system tests. Of course, we'll also look at what acceptance testing is, how we come up with acceptance tests, and some of the best ways to write acceptance tests for a web application using Behavior-Driven Development and Selenium WebDriver.
Automated Browser Testing with Selenium WebDriver
Selenium WebDriver is extremely powerful, particularly when coupled with the efficient and tried-and-tested approach recommended in this course. We'll design our acceptance tests professionally—just the way you'd do at a software testing job. We'll use page models, locators, and step definitions to structure the automated tests in a reusable way. The customers will be able to come up with acceptance tests that you can easily translate to code.
We'll also learn about implicit and explicit waits with Selenium WebDriver and Python, a key concept to speed up runtime of your acceptance tests.
Continuous Integration
We also cover how you can take automated testing much further in your projects.
By implementing a Continuous Integration pipeline that runs your tests whenever you make any changes, you'll have much higher quality in your projects and not let any pesky bugs pass you by. We'll look at putting our projects in GitHub and liking the CI pipeline with them.
I'm really excited to guide you through this course!
Join me in this automated testing journey. I'll see you on the inside!

Sound exciting? Let’s get started.
This course will introduce some key elements of game programming. And I believe, the best way to learn game programming is by making one. So, I will walk you through the process of creating an android game, from start to finish, step by step in a completely hands-on fashion, sharing some super useful resources along the way. As we move on, we will be creating a small game called “Plane Shooter”. Finally, this course will improve your problem-solving ability as I invite you to find the solution yourself so that you can think like a programmer. I will also be available to support you along the way.
You may be motivated to make your own games that others would love to play or may be motivated by the money you can make if your game becomes very popular and in-demand or you are passionate about the gaming industry and decided to start your career as a game developer. Whatever your motivation, you need to have the solid knowledge of game programming and the skills required to make your Android game a reality. A game that you build yourself, and publish is a fantastic resume piece and could help you get a great job you might not otherwise be able to get. Even if you don't plan on doing the actual coding itself, it may be important to know at least the basics of Java which is the preferred language for Android games development. Why Android? Because you will find the android to have a larger amount of players available. Many tablets and smartphones use Google store as well as the Amazon store which are android based. Getting your app to a big success is greatly dependent upon its exposure. Putting it in the Android mainstream market is one way to get it to the #1.So what you are waiting for?

As you probably already know, it's relatively easy to start building Android applications. However, many Android projects face major slow-downs and maintainability issues after just several months of development. The reason for such an unfortunate outcome is lack of good design and architecture guidelines for Android applications. 
This course presents you with a complete picture of Android applications architecture. I will explain you why software architecture is important in general, and you'll see how the best architectural patterns apply in Android development. We will discuss many real-world scenarios and you'll understand the trade-offs involved in writing clean code.
All the concepts and techniques you'll learn in this course had already been tested and proved themselves in commercial Android applications. This is the most advanced resource that brings you years of professional industry experience with Android architecture in the most concise and clear form.

Professional grade design and architecture for Android applications
Optimized for experienced Android developers
Concise
Hands-on exercises
Source code of the tutorial app on GitHub with step-by-step commits history

The main architectural patterns covered in this course are:
MVx
MVx is a family of presentation layer architectural patterns (MVC, MVP, MVVM, etc.). You'll learn the basics of MVx, understand how these patterns benefit you and see what distinguishes good implementations in Android apps from unfortunate ones. After you'll understand the fundamentals, I'll show you the best MVx pattern for Android applications.
Clean Architecture
We will touch upon the most important concepts of so-called ""Clean Architecture"" school of though and see how they apply in Android. You'll learn to implement ""use cases"" (also known as ""interactors""), structure application's packages according to its architecture and manage inter-dependencies between components.
Dependency Injection
No discussion of Android architecture can be complete without a dependency injection architectural pattern. You'll learn the fundamental theory of dependency injection and see the implementation of so-called Pure Dependency Injection in the tutorial application.
Throughout the course I'll highlight many important design and architectural trade-offs which you'll need to consider as a professional Android developer. These seemingly small and often overlooked decisions can make the difference between clean and maintainable applications and tightly coupled, unmaintainable code.
We will conclude the course with a general discussion of the goals, the benefits and the scope of software architecture. This will allow you to grasp the bigger picture and understand what's required of professional software developers in context of real-world projects.
So, enroll now and take your Android design and architecture skills to the next level. I can't wait to see you inside."

Welcome to the first ObjectBox course for Android development. Here you will learn how to add a database to any mobile or IoT application or refactor its current database into a really efficient one. 
My name is Andrei Dan and I'll be leading you through the course. 
I have more than 6 years of experience as and Android software engineer.
I designed this course for anyone seeking to learn an efficient object-oriented database for small devices.  
By the end of the course you will be able to design, code and integrate your database with real applications.
I'll be teaching the ObjectBox Database, which is designed for mobile and IoT applications, optimised for performance and saves you from dealing with SQL. 
The motto of Objectbox is: Less code is better code which means that it's very easy to work with and makes it very readable and beginner friendly. 
Not only shall we cover the details of ObjectBox, but we’ll also practice it, using selected examples. 
The ideal student for this course is an existing Java or Android developer, who wants to expand their current skills, or a student who is currently learning Java and Android. 
There are no other requirements to enroll, you only need to come open-midned and ready to learn.
Feel free to look through the course description and I am looking forward to seeing you inside.
 Here are some of the advantages of ObjectBox:
Performance is the number one reason why I chose ObjectBox. Its authors created greenDAO, the fastest Object/Relational Mapper (ORM) for Android and SQLite. Since its first release in 2011, they gained a lot of insight into object persistence – and the performance limitations imposed by SQLite. They realized that in order to improve performance on mobile significantly, they needed to go to the core and build a database designed for objects.
Superfast: ObjectBox was built to deliver the best possible performance. It outperforms all embedded databases we ever tested (which are quite a few), typically by a factor 5 to 15.
Object API: No more rows, columns and SQL – ObjectBox is a database built for objects from ground up (no ORM, no SQLite). The concise API is easy to learn and just takes a fraction of the code you would need to work with SQLite.
Instant unit testing: With ObjectBox's multi-platform approach, you can run plain unit tests on the desktop (no Robolectric, no instrumentation tests) with a real database in an instant.
Simple threading: Objects returned by ObjectBox work in all threads with no strings attached.
No manual schema migrations: ObjectBox takes care of new object versions with added, removed, and renamed entities and properties.

In order to deliver an extendable, maintainable, and testable codebase, you have to think about the architecture of your application from the very first stage of its development.
This course will show you all new Android Jetpack Architecture components and features. You will develop Android applications by making use of all the architecture components available with Jetpack to reduce bugs in your codebase and provide seamless and smooth application development. Adding architectural components to your projects will increase their scalability and reduce code bugs.
By the end of the course, you will know how to use Jetpack to manage background tasks, navigation, paging, life-cycle management, and much more.

A step-by-step approach guiding you through Java, Android Studio and Google Firebase and particularly focuses on student engagement.  ***

*** Free eBook of the course. Over 300 pages of the lectures plus a glossary of the terms used. ***

This course will take a good look at how to become a developer of Android Apps. It will provide you with much of the basics - some initial programming skills, plus some basic Java and Android App development using Android Studio. We also look into some of the database communications for our chosen database, Google’s Json Firebase database, and the features that we are going to use along the way.
You will receive a tour of Android Studio and be shown ways in which to enrich your Android Development code and thus, your final Android App.

***** Terrific course with a huge amount covered. A perfect course for gaining basic knowledge about Android app development and design overall. The Firebase section is useful but would be nice if it went further - maybe there is a new course for them to make to do that !!

***** Very helpful. I shall try to use this info in my own apps, but should be good. I like the lecture format and the accompanying book is useful to work alongside the video. I would like some more on Firebase databases but I gather they are producing a course specifically on that. Will definitely buy that too.

***** Really, really useful. This course had all I wanted to get a good start at writing my own apps. I thought it was generally well explained and at a pace I could follow. I like the challenges to test myself on what I'd learned. A good speed for me.

***** I saw the course announcement regarding the revamp of the course so thought I would take a look. Wow! A lot has changed but the new look is great and the course (so far!) is really engaging. Loving the challenges and feel like I might actually be a decent developer in the making. Keep the good work up!

***** exceptional!



So, where to start?

Once the course is underway, together we are going develop a Java-based Chat App and examine every step of its journey, from the concept and the initial design within Android Studio, some fantastic tips on how to organise your work and make your life so much simpler, ideas on how to implement these thoughts into a workable Android App and through to the final publication on the Google Play Store. Along the way, we will look at using Google’s Json Firebase database and Android Studio and the concept of user-authentication.

These object-oriented skills are vital if you want to become an expert in Android App development, whether for pleasure or a possible income stream. You will learn the basic building blocks in Java and Android Studio, and the course does not require any particular Android version. There are some thought-provoking and interesting student Android App development challenges throughout each lecture, and the small quizzes along the way will test your growing knowledge and show just how much you have learnt but, most importantly, you are in charge of the pace at which you wish to learn.

Android device apps are a now huge industry, grown out of all proportion in recent years, so the skills to create fantastic apps are highly sought after. The Android Developer’s Journey is a step-by-step guide through the concepts of building a great app. Over the course of over 100 quality lectures - over 14 hours of lessons -  we start at the basics of Java and Android Development, then using the Android Studio development environment we take a single chat app from some simple design thoughts through to the implementation of the java coding. This Java app requires a database so we use Google Firebase for user authentication and data storage. We look at the user interface before seeing how to publish the finished app on the Google Play store. A complete Android App Development guide from start to finish.

So, what are you waiting for? Build a fantastic grounding in Android App Development, Android Studio and object-oriented Java Programming with this brilliant course and who knows where it will take you.

Why Take This Course?
I've been involved with Kotlin since late 2015, before it was released in its first stable version. As the instructor of the course ""Kotlin for Beginners"", I know which topics students are interested in or get stuck with.
My first Kotlin course is recommended from the official Kotlin website and from the official Android website as a resource to learn Kotlin for Android. So you can be sure to get quality teaching here.
After this course, you'll be able to confidently use Kotlin for any kind of project -- but we'll of course apply what we learn to Android app development in this course.

What Makes This Course Special?
Since Google's #IO17 announcement to officially support Kotlin on Android, many new courses on the topic have been released -- which is great because it further helps to spread the language.
What makes this course special is that while most other courses do not teach good coding style, this course will focus on producing clean code and teaches you to make use of Kotlin's amazing features to actually write better code than in Java. This way, you will get a huge benefit using Kotlin instead of Java, e.g. by avoiding boilerplate code around many Android APIs.

What This Course Is NOT
This course is not an Android reference, I assume you already have at least some Android experience. Instead, you'll learn to write cleaner code for your apps by applying Kotlin's powerful language features to avoid unnecessary ceremony around Android APIs. Also, at the end of the course, you'll be able to use Kotlin for any kind of project -- not just for Android apps.

What Students Say About Me (taken from ""Kotlin for Beginners"")
""TLDR; One of the best Kotlin course for beginners on Udemy! I took some time to write this review and wanted to finish the course THEN watch other courses offered here on Udemy and THEN want to see how good Peter was in teaching me basics of Kotlin so that I can apply the knowledge while writing actual android apps. And I am happy to report that it has helped me immensely. It wouldn't be wrong if I say that the I was easily understanding the WHYs and WHATs even if the teacher wasn't explaining in detail in other courses... Thank you Peter! You have taught me well! [...]""

What You'll Learn
...and much more! This course will grow based on your feedback.
 
------
What is Kotlin?
Kotlin is a modern language for the JVM, and the only officially supported language on Android beside Java. It's developed by Jetbrains, the makers of IntelliJ on which Android Studio is based.
Since Google's announcement to officially support Kotlin in 2017, interest in the language has radically increased -- and with it the number of tutorials, courses, books, and also job offers for Kotlin. It's a great time to dive into this modern language and get ahead of other Android developers!
With its modern language design that incorporates industry best practices, Kotlin allows you to write highly expressive, understandable and safe code -- while being 100% interoperable with Java. You can use any Java classes and methods from Kotlin and the other way around.
This courses shows you what language features I mean, and how you can apply them in order to write world-class code."

Why learn to make Android apps?   
·      Android is without a doubt THE biggest mobile platform in the world, with over 80% market share and over 1 billion devices sold in 2016 alone.   
·      You can develop for Android on a Windows, Mac or Linux computer.   
·      Java is a fantastic language to learn, allowing you to make apps for PC, Mac and the web, as well as Android.   
·      Android app discovery is way superior to the App Store, so your app has a far better chance of getting seen—and bought.   
·      Ad-based revenue is a lot more common on Android than on iOS, and a cinch to set up with Google Ads.

  
“Top class professional presentation of a well-constructed course. Consistently pitched at the right level to remain interesting and challenging, this course quickly brings the student to a point where generating their own applications is realistic and fun.”

  
Who is this for?

I wanted to make this course because when I was first learning mobile development, I tried going online and finding beginner videos and courses. What I found is that, they were great at teaching surface concepts as a starting point, but in and of themselves, they weren’t enough to explain how to build an app beyond a certain point of complexity. So, if you’re coming off of a beginner tutorial, you have some prior knowledge of Java and you understand some Android concepts such as the activities and lifecycles, then this is a great next step to further deepen your skillset and really stand out when applying for a job or trying to make a quality app by yourself.
 
What Are We Going to Make? 
We’re going to be making a “Google Notes” clone with the following features:
1.    Make tasks that are broken down into todos
2.    Todos can be checked off as completed or incomplete and appropriately displayed
3.    Notes will be displayed on a separate view from tasks and todos
4.    Both notes and tasks will be stored in a SQL database
Building this app is a great way to learn good software architecture and object-oriented principles. For example, we’ll be able to reuse a lot of our code within the adapters and the view models when displaying a task list and a notes list if properly architecture. 
 Also, this is just the no frills version of the app. Along the way after teaching each concept, I’ll have assignments followed by solutions on how to add deeper complexity into the app such as adding coloured tags for tasks, or making a list for only active tasks. By the end of it, you’ll have a clean and material design adherent app that you can customize to your delight and use as a reference point to implementing your own app idea.
 
What Is Different?
Apart from learning new trends in Android such as Kotlin, Google Architecture Components, and MVVM, I’ll also introduce you to a few popular libraries and tools that are widely used in industry to allow greater team collaboration and reusability of code. 
1.    Dependency Injection– If you’ve ever heard of Dagger or Toothpick as a library and wondered why it’s so cool, this will teach you!
2.    Coroutines– One of the biggest advancements in Kotlin is the ease of multi-threading and writing concurrent applications. Whether it’s making a database query or waiting for a network request, what used to be a very complex task in Java without the use of a third-party library is now fast and built into Kotlin. This is also one of the few courses to explain how multi-threading and concurrency works which is transferable to almost any field of programming, not just mobile development!
3. Google Architecture Components- Learning how to use pre-made templates for ViewModels will facilitate the MVVM architecture which greatly helps simplify code and speed up development time and using the Room SQL Database Library will enable developers to persist data at ease.
4. JUnit and Mockito Testing is a vital part of programming when working in the industry where apps need to be reliable and robust to serve a large number of users while keeping testing time as low as possible. "

Because now it works. With the arrival of cloud computing and multi-core machines - we have enough compute capacity at our disposal to churn large volumes of data and dig out the hidden patterns contained in these mountains of data.
This technology comes in handy, especially when handling Big Data. Today, companies collect and accumulate data at massive, unmanageable rates for website clicks, credit card transactions, GPS trails, social media interactions, and so on. And it is becoming a challenge to process all the valuable information and use it in a meaningful way. This is where machine learning algorithms come into the picture. These algorithms use all the collected “past” data to learn patterns and predict results or insights that help us make better decisions backed by actual analysis.
You may have experienced various examples of Machine Learning in your daily life (in some cases without even realizing it). Take for example 
In all these examples, machine learning is used to build models from historical data, to forecast the future events with an acceptable level of reliability. This concept is known as Predictive analytics. To get more accuracy in the analysis, we can also combine machine learning with other techniques such as data mining or statistical modeling.
This progress in the field of machine learning is great news for the tech industry and humanity in general. But the downside is that there aren’t enough data scientists or machine learning engineers who understand these complex topics.
Well, what if there was an easy to use a web service in the cloud - which could do most of the heavy lifting for us? What if scaled dynamically based on our data volume and velocity?
The answer - is new cloud service from Microsoft called Azure Machine Learning. Azure Machine Learning is a cloud-based data science and machine learning service which is easy to use and is robust and scalable like other Azure cloud services. It provides visual and collaborative tools to create a predictive model which will be ready-to-consume on web services without worrying about the hardware or the VMs which perform the calculations.
The advantage of Azure ML is that it provides a UI-based interface and pre-defined algorithms that can be used to create a training model. And it also supports various programming and scripting languages like R and Python. 
In this course, we will discuss Azure Machine Learning in detail. You will learn what features it provides and how it is used. We will explore how to process some real-world datasets and find some patterns in that dataset.
These are some of the fundamental problems data scientists and engineers struggle with on a daily basis.
This course teaches you how to design, deploy, configure and manage your machine learning models with Azure Machine Learning. The course will start with an introduction to the Azure ML toolset and features provided by it and then dive deeper into building some machine learning models based on some real-world problems 
If you’re serious about building scalable, flexible and powerful machine learning models in the cloud, then this course is for you. 
These data science skills are in great demand, but there’s no easy way to acquire this knowledge. Rather than rely on hit and trial method, this course will provide you with all the information you need to get started with your machine learning projects. 
Startups and technology companies pay big bucks for experience and skills in these technologies They demand data science and cloud engineers make sense of their dormant data collected on their servers  -  and in turn, you can demand top dollar for your abilities. 
You may be a data science veteran or an enthusiast - if you invest your time and bring an eagerness to learn, we guarantee you real, actionable education at a fraction of the cost you can demand as a data science engineer or a consultant. We are confident your investment will come back to you many-fold in no time.

In the coming years, there won't be a single industry in the world untouched by Machine Learning.  A transformative force, you can either choose to understand it now, or lose out on a wave of incredible change.  You probably already use apps many times each day that rely upon Machine Learning techniques.  So why stay in the dark any longer?
There are many courses on Machine Learning already available.  I built this course to be the best introduction to the topic.  No subject is left untouched, and we never leave any area in the dark.  If you take this course, you will be prepared to enter and understand any sub-discipline in the world of Machine Learning.

A common question - Why Javascript?  I thought ML was all about Python and R?
The answer is simple - ML with Javascript is just plain easier to learn than with Python.  Although it is immensely popular, Python is an 'expressive' language, which is a code-word that means 'a confusing language'.  A single line of Python can contain a tremendous amount of functionality; this is great when you understand the language and the subject matter, but not so much when you're trying to learn a brand new topic.
Besides Javascript making ML easier to understand, it also opens new horizons for apps that you can build.  Rather than being limited to deploying Python code on the server for running your ML code, you can build single-page apps, or even browser extensions that run interesting algorithms, which can give you the possibility of developing a completely novel use case!

Does this course focus on algorithms, or math, or Tensorflow, or what?!?!
Let's be honest - the vast majority of ML courses available online dance around the confusing topics.  They encourage you to use pre-build algorithms and functions that do all the heavy lifting for you.  Although this can lead you to quick successes, in the end it will hamper your ability to understand ML.  You can only understand how to apply ML techniques if you understand the underlying algorithms.
That's the goal of this course - I want you to understand the exact math and programming techniques that are used in the most common ML algorithms.  Once you have this knowledge, you can easily pick up new algorithms on the fly, and build far more interesting projects and applications than other engineers who only understand how to hand data to a magic library.
Don't have a background in math?  That's OK! I take special care to make sure that no lecture gets too far into 'mathy' topics without giving a proper introduction to what is going on.

A short list of what you will learn:
Advanced memory profiling to enhance the performance of your algorithms
Build apps powered by the powerful Tensorflow JS library
Develop programs that work either in the browser or with Node JS
Write clean, easy to understand ML code, no one-name variables or confusing functions
Pick up the basics of Linear Algebra so you can dramatically speed up your code with matrix-based operations. (Don't worry, I'll make the math easy!)
Comprehend how to twist common algorithms to fit your unique use cases
Plot the results of your analysis using a custom-build graphing library
Learn performance-enhancing strategies that can be applied to any type of Javascript code
Data loading techniques, both in the browser and Node JS environments"

And there are good reasons for this.
These topics will shape the world of tomorrow and will tremendously influence our future working environment. So it is up to all of us to start diving into these subjects (Machine Learning, AI, Cloud) and understand what they mean and how to use them. This will be a key factor and open up new and better job opportunities.
The big question is how? How can we dive into these topics? What if you can't code or do not like to do it? What if you are not a mathematician or data scientist? Is there still an option?
Short Answer. Absolutely! Were there is a will, there is a way! And this way is exactly what I would like to show you here. Together we will learn a high level understanding of important machine learning concepts and create our own machine learning experiments in the cloud. We will learn to use both technologies together and create own machine learning experiments. 
The best of all
No coding required
No addtional fees - we will use the cloud for free
exited? I really hope so.
Let's get into it! I see you in the first lecture"
