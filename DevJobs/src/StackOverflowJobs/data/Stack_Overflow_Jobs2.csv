For over 15 years Quantium have combined the best of human and artificial intelligence to power possibilities for individuals, organisations and society. Our solutions make sense of what has happened and what will, could or should be done to re-shape industries and societies around the needs of the people they serve.
Times and technology have changed, but this remains our goal. Instead of wrangling single, SQL-based databases, our MapR Hadoop platform runs across 300 nodes with multiple clusters using the latest big data technology.
We’re looking for that rarity to lead our future technology and approach. You’ll be testing out any data orientated tech you want – you think we can take that 4 hour processing time down to 10 mins using Kafka? Give it a go! Prove it. Think that Scala has had its’ day and we need to move to something more useable? Show us a model.
Whatever you can prove, we’ll go for, just bear in mind, you’re the subject matter expert so you’re going to have to field the questions and teach people how to use it.
FAQ:
Sooo… I have a Sandbox to play in?
Kinda… you’ll be given a huge amount of free rein to try a range of technologies and apply them to our problem sets. You will also have to prove to professional sceptics that this is the right path, and then support your initiatives with hard data.
How does this team work?
You’ll be joining the Data and Platforms Team as their Lead Analyst. The team is responsible for investigating, testing and implementing the technology solutions that power our insight. There are 8 engineers and 6 analysts in this team. You’ll have a team of 4 Analysts under you and work closely with the engineering team to implement your ideas. 
What are you looking for in the ideal candidate?
You’ll be a career Analyst or Data Scientist. Data scale is something you’re very used to; machine learning, decision trees, neural networks (insert more buzzwords) will all be areas you’re familiar with, along with the code to use them. You’ll be at a time in your career where you’re a bit bored of working on client problems, to client timelines and are fascinated by technology. You’ll love tinkering, experimenting with new tech, and most importantly, be used to following through on your recommendations.

CANDIS is looking for someone who is both able and hungry to join the team as our new Head of Product. You are looking at a hands-on role that combines the operational aspects of a PM/PO with the strategic business aspects of owning CANDIS’ product vision.Aside of ensuring that our Product-related day-to-day operations are running smoothly, your responsibilities include:

As our Head of Product, you are the main facilitator between all of our internal and external stakeholders. You drive cross-functional collaboration across our teams to coordinate efforts in serving our customers. You conduct user interviews, attend meetups and conventions but you also turn to our Sales, Marketing, Customer Success, Operations and Tech teams to better understand our users.
In close collaboration with our VP of Engineering you align your colleagues on strategic business goals. You bridge the technical and business worlds as you design services that our users love.
You communicate product updates, launches etc. to our users
You identify and ensure relevant business metrics are met
You always have your finger on the pulse of our users and an eye on the market. You understand our product’s strengths and weaknesses and know how to translate them into success stories.

TL;DR - you own and execute a successful product strategy in order to facilitate rapid growth with a Best-in-Class product that aims at disrupting the way that companies go about their finances and accounting.
ABOUT YOU
You are an analytical and highly organized person who combines a strong user-orientation and a keen eye for usable & loveable products with outstanding communication skills. After all - requirements change and empathy is key if you want to successfully work together with all stakeholders.You realize why understanding our users is essential and you rely on data to help you make the right calls. Those reports are helpful and all but the countless hours you’ve put into following blogs, reading articles or suppressing your need for sleep to watch the TC Disrupt live stream leave you with a pretty good idea of what’s going on in the (Fin)Tech universe. Though you don’t only recognize and follow trends - you’re looking to set them.Not all of the job is research and planning though. Perhaps the most important part is the execution. When we say ‘hands-on’, we mean that you lead by example and are the first to jump into the proverbial trenches.
YOUR EXPERIENCE
Since you’ve already filled senior product roles before, you know the ins and outs of a webapp’s product lifecycle. You have successfully launched SaaS products from vision to production and onto further iterations and growth. You’ve previously worked in rapid growth environments within a B2B (ideally FinTech) context that gave you the space and resources to hone your skills over the years. Along the way you’ve demonstrated the ability to achieve strategic goals in an innovative and fast-paced environment.You have a clear understanding of what unique challenges and issues a SaaS product faces. Not only are you confident in your ability to create a usable and loveable product, you do so while taking business aspects into consideration.Several years of hands-on experience have left you with a very firm knowledge of:

Shipping products from concept to launch
Working with technical teams to rapidly produce prototypes and iterations
Managing roadmaps
Writing user stories
Functional, visual & interactive design
Gathering user requirements/ doing user research and data savviness
You’re able to jump in as Scrum master if the need arises and are familiar with tools like Jira, InVision etc.

Our working languages are both German and English and a large majority of our users speak German. We expect you to be fluent both in spoken as well as in written German and English.Please keep in mind that we’re describing the background we imagine would best fit the role. Even if you don’t meet all requirements, yet you’re confident that you’re up for the task, we absolutely want to get to know you!
LET'S GET IN TOUCH!

Job DescriptionWith a rapidly expanding program of major engineering projects, we need team leaders focused on project delivery and client satisfaction. The day to day requirements of the role will change with each project, depending on its technical profile, its scale, and the situation of the engineers within the project team as a whole. But in every case we need Lead Developers who not only meet our exacting engineering standards, but who also excel in the areas of team leadership and management, client communications and project planning.
Our approach to delivery (flat structures, minimal division of labour) mean that we tend to have small teams for any given size of project. The teams, however, are highly skilled and extremely agile, which tests the skills of our team leaders (Lead Developers) in mapping the team and its work onto projects that are often complex and high risk, and with rapidly evolving requirements. We need capable team leads who are persistent and persuasive, and who not only know how to run a project so that it can succeed, but also what to do when things are going wrong.SkillsOn the purely technical side, we recruit people who combine breadth and depth of outlook and experience. This reflects the broad nature of the work we are required to do. We systematically turn our hands to a range of technologies; we have built projects that are deployed on Unix, Windows, OS X, Android & iOS, and, for example, have used C#, Clojure, Erlang, F#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Objective C, Python, Ruby, Scala, and Scheme in production. You must have sufficient engineering / Computer science depth to be able to learn and apply new technologies quickly. A good candidate will have some of the following technical skills and attributes:

Knowledge of algorithms, data structures, complexity
Experience with different programming paradigms (definitely OO, at least one of functional or declarative, and any others a bonus)
Versed in several programming languages
Familiarity with, eg., test driven development, continuous integration, micro service architecture, containerisation
A passion for open source technologies and open standards
A passion for technology in general
Good Unix and Windows skills

However, in this position we are looking not only for those technical skills, but also the kind of leadership, presentation and management skills that will allow you to lead teams of our engineers on projects. A good candidate will have a mix of the following leadership skills, capabilities and experience:

Knowledge of project delivery tools and methodologies (Agile, Waterfall, etc.)
Proven team leadership and mentoring skills
Proven client handling and communications skills
Experience of all stages in the project life-cycle
Ability to



apply software design principles across a wide range of architectures
act as a systems architect
lead significant systems integration projects
handle significant client engagement issues on a project
act as a technical product manager
provide technical consultancy in a client-facing role
work well with non-technical stakeholders

We are a small, rapidly growing team building a product in a very promising space. We’re located in the heart of Toronto at University and Dundas. There’s free coffee. There’s snacks.

We want someone who is not interested in being a small cog in a large machine. We want someone who wants to have a big impact and wants the satisfaction of rapidly seeing their code improve a product in the hands of real users. We’re growing fast and we are looking for someone whose talents will scale with the business. We want someone who relishes researching, finding, and implementing solutions to tough challenges.

Let's schedule a brief 20-minute session to get to know each other.
How we work

We strongly believe in the importance of uninterrupted time to get stuff done and quality over quantity when it comes to working hours. We prefer to keep our schedule meeting-light and work in a library-like atmosphere during the core hours.
We believe the ability to give and get constructive feedback and express divergent ideas is crucial to make innovation come to life. We live a very open discussion culture and prefer the evaluation of ideas based on merit over top-down decision making.

We don't see people as ""resources"" and genuinely care about each other. We also understand that there's more than fancy perks and cool events to people's satisfaction and engagement. We continuously work towards an environment providing a lot of autonomy, transparency and development opportunities and rely on everybody's feedback to hold us accountable for maintaining our high standards.

        ",200,VC Funded,"
Who are we and what do we do?
We develop the Mews Platform, which is a suite of applications and a hub for connecting properties, guests, and other vendors from the hospitality industry. If you would like to know more about our story and why we decided to build these products, you can read more at https://mewssystems.com/products.
To summarize, we’ve built the following products:
• Mews Commander - This is our primary project, which is a Property Management System made for hotels. This system stores all reservations helps manage housekeeping, and enables properties to set their prices in real time. This is also a great solution for hostels, which operate very differently from hotels. Commander covers accounting, reporting, communication with channels (booking.com etc.), credit card payments, key cutting, and many more features.
• Mews Distributor - Our customizable booking engine widget, which properties can embed on their very own website to convert guests directly. Check out an example of Distributor in action at http://emblemprague.com.
• Mews Navigator - An application (web and iOS) used for direct communication between properties and their guests. Aside from the messaging feature, it offers guests the ability to check in online and submit their own personal information. Therefore, when guest arrive at the property, all their information is already in the system, which significantly speeds up their on-site check-in time.
Mews Backend:
The backend of Mews Platform is built with ASP.net MVC, Entity Framework, and is deployed on Azure. Our main concerns include high-availability, high-scalability, and multiregional support. We aim for continuous delivery and continuous integration using TeamCity, GitHub, and YouTrack.
Who are we looking for?
We are looking for someone with web development experience and a strong understanding of .net and MVC. Candidates should also be able to communicate effectively in English. We are not micro-managers or hand-holders, so we expect you to find your own way from day one. A good cultural fit is important as well. We are all very motivated, but we like people who can deliver strong results while working independently.
Since we have a small team, we are not looking for people who are still learning how to code. We need candidates to be ready. We want to extend the core of the backend team so that once we have enough people, you would be teaching juniors. This is not a position for working remotely. We do not want you to become ""an employee"", rather we want you to grow with us and eventually become the leader of your own product team. If you meet these qualifications and plan to stay with us for a while, we think you’d be a great fit.
What can you expect?

Freedom to choose your own working hours, as long as you deliver results
Work with a super motivated and highly experienced team of young professionals
Guaranteed career growth potential
Competitive compensation package
Friendly and relaxed work culture

Where will you work from?
Prague, Czech Republic

We are building a sophisticated OLAP/SQL query engine for advanced analytics, accessing data from many different data sources (RDBMS's, Hive, Impala, Druid, Elasticsearch and others). The query engine is written in Scala and builds on Apache Calcite. We are planning to open-source it during the course of this year with the goal of making it an Apache project eventually.
The stack
Scala, Java, Apache Calcite, Apache Spark
The challenge
The project involves working with many interesting concepts related to data processing and querying such as query parsing and validation, relational algebra, creation of logical and physical plans and adapters to different database and execution engines. Your work will also involve participation in the communities of and development of contributions to Calcite and other open-source libraries we use.
Your profile
Being fluent in Java and Scala is a must.
We highly appreciate experience in:

Open source projects, especially those by the Apache foundation
SQL & OLAP-type query planning & optimisation
Relational algebra as a foundation for relational databases
Database adapters (both sql & no-sql)

How we work

We strongly believe in the importance of uninterrupted time to get stuff done and quality over quantity when it comes to working hours. We prefer to keep our schedule meeting-light and work in a library-like atmosphere during the core hours.
We believe the ability to give and get constructive feedback and express divergent ideas is crucial to make innovation come to life. We live a very open discussion culture and prefer the evaluation of ideas based on merit over top-down decision making.
We strongly believe in ownership of one's features, from spec to implementation to operation. We also understand that ownership comes with a sense of responsibility towards others that depend on the results of our work.
We believe that everybody should be able to find meaning in their work. We match assignments based on both ability and individual interests and discuss your progress and individual needs every 3 months.
We don't see people as ""resources"" and genuinely care about each other. We also understand that there's more than fancy perks and cool events to people's satisfaction and engagement. We continuously work towards an environment providing a lot of autonomy, transparency and development opportunities and rely on everybody's feedback to hold us accountable for maintaining our high standards.

We see the interview process as a mutual opportunity to get to know each other — at eye level. That's why we always strive to respond within hours, not weeks.

These types of conversations often involve topics like how our home-grown scripting language (called “Painless”) should evolve, how our plugin framework should work to enable entirely new use cases of the software while simultaneously protecting new users, how we should version our APIs, and how we (and our users) should benchmark our distributed java-based server.  
To be successful in this role, you need to be able to be comfortable speaking to developers as customers and to understand and think through API interactions for modern software stacks. You will work closely with our engineering teams to plan and prioritize key underlying server features and APIs and with product marketing, sales, and our users to evangelize them.

What You Will Be Doing:

Work with customers on understanding the special needs of their use cases and bringing those insights back to engineering
Work with our engineers that work on performance benchmarking, server architecture, and core APIs to improve everything from how a developer can extend the capabilities of Elasticsearch to how solution architects and support can arm users with relevant benchmarks and benchmarking practices
Work with product marketing on demos showcasing our server’s features and with our sales, support, and consultants to make sure they understand the new features engineering is developing
Track and improve KPIs around adoption and usage of Elasticsearch

What You Bring Along:

You are an experienced Product Manager who has a high-level understanding of how developers consume APIs 
You have prior experience working on Java applications and server software 
And you're curious, collaborative, and empathetic.

In addition, you are/have:

Bachelor’s degree in a technical field (e.g. CS, CSE, EE) or relevant work experience writing code to some extent 
Comfort working in a highly distributed team
Excellent spoken and written English communication skills
Prior history working on search and/or NLP systems 
Open source software and/or commercial open source companies experience 
SQL, geo, or benchmarking experience 

Additional Information:
We're looking to hire team members invested in realizing the goal of making real-time data exploration easy and available to anyone. As a distributed company, we believe that diversity drives our vibe! Whether you're looking to launch a new career or grow an existing one, Elastic is the type of company where you can balance great work with great life.

Work with product marketing on demos showcasing our server’s features and with our sales, support, and consultants to make sure they understand the new features engineering is developing
Track and improve KPIs around adoption and usage of Elasticsearch

What You Bring Along:

You have prior experience working on Java applications and server software

Excellent spoken and written English communication skills

Job DescriptionSince 2001, our software engineers have helped tackle the complex and interesting challenge of discovering value hidden in the world’s data. We are pushing the technical envelope to solve these problems, and in the process are helping to redefine investment management and other fields. As the world of data continues to grow exponentially, the issues they address will only increase in difficulty, scale and excitement.In order to meet these challenges, we’ve built a data accumulation platform that allows us to ingest over 10 terabytes of data per day, and a custom distributed storage solution to store the over 50 petabytes of information we’ve accumulated since our inception. We’ve also built an entire suite of analysis tools that enable our quantitative researchers to utilize this data to produce predictive models that help us automatically invest each and every day.This model-driven, technology-fueled approach to investing not only gives us a long-term advantage over old-school investors – it has also created a whole set of technical problems to solve that don’t always have an obvious solution. This gives you the ongoing opportunity to build proprietary solutions and/or bring to bear the best open source options the market. We have created a robust infrastructure that empowers all of our engineers, and you will work within a collaborative work culture that ensures that a great idea can come from anywhere.Problems at our level of complexity require you to possess a passion for learning as well as deep understanding across a wide array of technical competencies. We’ve attracted technologists who possess special capabilities in a wide variety of domains including data transformation and visualization, performance optimization, cloud computing, and distributed systems. While we face large-scale problems, we hire only the best to take them on. This enables us to keep your team size small and your individual impact significant.While there is no set recipe for success, we find that you will tend to have the following qualifications:  You have at least a bachelor’s degree in a technical or quantitative field, preferably in Computer Science   You have an understanding of data structures and algorithms.   You have experience with Java (or other JVM languages), Python, C or C++.   You have extraordinary programming skills.   You have demonstrated experience in large-scale systems.

Nokia is a global leader in the technologies that connect people and things.
With state-of-the-art software, hardware and services for any type of network, Nokia is uniquely positioned to help communication service providers, governments, and large enterprises deliver on the promise of 5G, the Cloud and the Internet of Things.
Mobile Networks Business Group provides end-to-end mobile networks solutions to service providers globally, including some of the largest telecommunications operators in the world.
Inside a worldwide R&D organization, you join a team that is currently being created from scratch. As an embedded software development engineer, you contribute to the design of the software for the SoC (System on Chip) that Nokia is making for 5G. These components are key to achieve 5G performances and they are developed using cutting-edge technologies.
Your main missions are:

Prepare project plan (schedule, resources, budget, dependencies…),
Lead and motivate the team to achieve project targets,
Set priorities (product backlog), identify risks / issues and implement mitigation / resolution actions,
Ensure compliance with Nokia process,
Cooperate with other teams (e.g. other SW teams and HW teams) to anticipate and resolve potential issues,
Track and report project status.

You have an Engineer’s or Master of Science degree, and you have an experience of at least 15 years, which has allowed you to acquire an excellent mastery of the design and development of embedded software, and of project management.
Good knowledge of C/C++ language and Linux, an extensive experience of working with Agile methodology, and continuous integration methods and related tools (e.g. Jenkins) are needed.
You must demonstrate leadership and good problem solving and risk management skills.
Good knowledge of SoC/ASIC development process would be a plus.
Your ability to work in an international context and to adapt to a complex technical environment will be key assets to succeed in this job.

This C++ vacancy has been at war, before either of us (the writer, vacancy and reader) even excited. Our C++ vacancy has been attacked by competitors for years... but today the battlefield has shifted to your screen.

Full-Stack Clojure Developer,"clojure, clojurescript, reactjs, postgresql, ansible",,Holanda,Den Haag,"Privacy Company
        ",50,Private,"
About the job
Full time position in our office in The Hague, Netherlands
Privacy Company helps businesses solve the privacy compliance problem, with a focus on bringing privacy awareness within reach of those who are not experts or lawyers. We’ve developed a web application, Privacy Nexus, that offers a very practical approach to reach this goal and has been designed to make privacy management easier, more efficient and more fun.
The development team currently consists of three developers and one designer, and we are looking for a new developer who can help us expand the product further. Given the small size of the team, there are countless opportunities to make an impact on both the product and our internal culture.
Our ideal colleague shares our passion for writing clean and modular code, enjoys (or at least is interested in learning) Functional Programming, and has been writing code for fun for years. Our technology stack of choice is Clojure for the backend and ClojureScript for the frontend (with React). We find that Clojure’s simplicity, immutability and data-first approach results in clearer code that is easy to reason about and to test. In contrast, we're not fans of OOP, XML and Design Patterns.
What we expect from you

Experience with Clojure is required.
However, if you're new to Clojure, but you have significant experience with front-end development, an affinity for UX, and you're willing to learn, that also works for us.
Experience with other functional programming languages (like Haskell, Common Lisp, Erlang, etc.) is always appreciated.
You are able to develop front-end interfaces without explicit design guidance.
You understand practical demands, but still strive to do things the right way.
You care about understanding problems at their root, with all the attention and dedication it requires.
You are a ""full-stack"" developer: you like to work on anything from database queries and backend code to fine tuning CSS and building React components.
You are familiar with command line tools: you know your way around git, bash/zsh/etc, grep (and perhaps, why not, the occasional perl one-liner).
You are comfortable working with a database without an ORM.
Formal Computer Science education is not a hard requirement, relevant education can be a plus, but we are more interested in what you have built than what you have learned

What we offer

A challenging, fun environment with lots of autonomy and self-direction
No hierarchy or project managers (we prefer self-organising)
Flexibility about when and where you work (however this is not a fully remote position, you should spend at least 1 day / week in the office with us)
You get to choose if you want a Mac or Linux laptop (or Windows, but why?)
Salary commensurate with your experience (32-40 hours/week)
Long term commitment is intended

Like what you hear? Drop us an email at developers@privacycompany.eu. If you want to apply for the position, please send your CV along with a link to your Github / GitLab / Bitbucket profile (or simply some code you worked on).
Note to International Applicants: Unfortunately we cannot sponsor Visas to the Netherlands, please apply only if you have a valid EU work permit.
No agency calls please. ",,"Legal Compliance, SaaS",Full-time,/jobs/193758/full-stack-clojure-developer-privacy-company,2019-01-07 11:51:27.423114,€,Full Stack Developer,10,26,18.0,211

You are an exceptional communicator in difficult conversations

We're looking for applicants with a minimum of 3 year's production experience, or you've completed a machine learning/statistics/physics PhD and want to become more applied. You should have experience owning complex projects from start to finish.
AS A TESSIAN DATA SCIENTIST YOU WILL:

Use machine learning to eliminate advanced security threats - our models are built to detect anomalies in the intricacies of human-to-human communications
Brainstorm ideas with your team and quickly mock up prototypes in Jupyter Notebooks
Be thrown into the exciting unknown - we like to focus on new problems so there is little prior research to rely on
Be responsible for getting your work into production (see here)
Work closely with the backend engineering team to deploy, monitor and iterate on your models
Learn new technologies and help decide which should make it into our production stack

Is React geen probleem voor je? Heb je een scherp oog voor user experience en een enorme liefde voor je vak? Lees dan verder en check of deze vacature wat voor jou is.
Als Senior Creative Front-end Developer van Kaliber realiseer je samen met een team van designers, strategen en mede-developers gave projecten voor uiteenlopende opdrachtgevers. Daarnaast heeft iedereen bij ons de vrijheid om in eigen projecten te experimenteren met nieuwe technologieën.
Benieuwd waarom wij react-router niet gebruiken? Vraag het erik@kaliber.net.
Wat je gaat doen

Afwisselend werk: je werkt aan campagnewebsites, complexe platformen en prototypes met nieuwe technologieën. Soms een project van een dag, soms een project van een aantal maanden.
Zichtbaar werk maken wat ertoe doet: je werkt nauw samen met opdrachtgevers zoals Fairtrade Original, bol.com, VUmc, AkzoNobel, VELUX, Milieudefensie en Independer aan creatieve oplossingen.
Samenwerken: collega’s kunnen goed met jou overleggen. Je hebt een duidelijke, op argumenten gebaseerde mening, maar staat altijd open voor andere standpunten.
Stack doorontwikkelen: samen met je mede-developers denk je na over hoe de tool stack van Kaliber zijn naam eer blijft aandoen, met als resultaat een high level stack en een vooruitstrevende visie op technologie.
Experimenteren en delen: je experimenteert graag met nieuwe technieken, blijft bij in je vakgebied en inspireert- en deelt je kennis met je mede-developers én de rest van Kaliber.
Technical lead: binnen een project neem je de leiding en de verantwoordelijkheid voor de techniek. Dankzij je ervaring kun je werkzaamheden realistisch inschatten en grote projecten draaien. Je spart met sales, projectmanagement en de opdrachtgever en geeft technisch advies: jij bent hét aanspreekpunt voor de techniek.
Vette shit maken: jouw front-end code brengt projecten tot leven door middel van lekkere micro-animaties en slicke transities.

Dit vragen we van jou

Je hebt veel ervaring met JavaScript en CSS, bent bekend met ES6, CSS methodologieën en je hebt gewerkt met moderne JavaScript libraries en frameworks, bij voorkeur React.
Je kunt zelfstandig projecten draaien en daarbinnen mede-developers aansturen. Je helpt hen groeien door je kennis over te dragen.
Je kunt goed samenwerken. Je hebt een duidelijke, op argumenten gebaseerde mening, maar staat altijd open voor andere standpunten. Je bent een sparringpartner voor iedereen, zowel voor opdrachtgevers en developers als niet-developers. Collega’s kunnen goed met jou overleggen.
Je weet wat browsers kunnen, wat de limitaties zijn en hoe je het maximale uit de verschillende browsers kunt halen.

Het is helemaal mooi als je

Graag experimenteert met physics engines, particle systems, Three.js, SVG, PIXI.js of de audio api.
Ervaring hebt met Unity.
Een applicatie hebt gebouwd in React Native.
Ervaring hebt met het maken van AR- of VR-applicaties.

Benieuwd waarom wij onze eigen build tool ontwikkeld hebben? Vraag het erik@kaliber.net.
Dit krijg je daarvoor terug
Naast een marktconform salaris, laptop om op te werken, uitgebreide lunch, en pensioenopbouw krijg je 25 vakantiedagen en élk jaar vrij op 5 mei.
Je werkplek bij Kaliber is een grote interactieve speeltuin met werkbanken, 3d printers, drones, buddhas, skateramp, VR brillen, nerf guns en een slimme bier koelkast. Maar het leukst zijn je collega’s: allemaal net zo gedreven als jij om mooi werk te maken.In de middag spelen we een potje voetbal en op vrijdagen drinken we samen een biertje.
Persoonlijke ontwikkeling vinden wij heel belangrijk en daarom organiseren we elke twee maanden Freaky Fridays: een tweedaagse hackathon onder werktijd waar je de ruimte krijgt om te experimenteren en leuke dingen te maken. Dat doen we niet voor opdrachtgevers, maar voor onszelf: problemen die je zelf interessant vindt om op te lossen. Ook gaan we graag naar FITC, TNW of DDD of andere meetups, workshops en conferenties en organiseren we The Kick.

Web Developer
We are searching for the best of the best in Software Development, seeking to build our team of brilliant and determined engineers working hard to build new technology in a field that is still being discovered.  Pyrofex is an environment where working hard is an assumption, challenges are expected, and managing minimal.
About Us
Pyrofex Corporation is one of Utah Valley’s newest cryptocurrency startups.  Founded in the Spring of 2016 by engineer Nash Foster and mathematician Mike Stay, Pyrofex is working to develop software that will run on cryptocurrency platforms and with smart contracts.  Starting from scratch, we’re making possibilities into realities in the fields of blockchain, cryptocurrency, and smart contracts.
The growth and development of people is the highest calling of leadership, which is understood and lived by our leaders.  All of our managers have a tech background, which allows them to truly understand projects, expectations, and struggles of each engineer.  High expectations are maintained, micromanaging is avoided, and everyone works together to stay on task and on time.
About You
At Pyrofex, we evaluate candidates based upon their skills and intelligence.  We look for potential as much as we look for experience. We know, particularly in a new field of technology, learning experiences are a fact of life.  We all make mistakes, we all struggle, and sometimes we all have to put in the over time to make it work.
Pyrofex hires individuals at all levels of experience.  We know that you are your best investment, and therefore, you are our best investment.  We expect all of our employees to increase their skills and abilities as they contribute to each project as a whole, and we will help and encourage them to do so.  However, strength and growth come only through continuous effort and struggle; some projects and assignments come easy, while others you have to push through. We all have moments where we wonder how we are going to overcome the next challenge.      
About the Job
We are currently hiring web developers to help us with our projects. Developers on this team will design, implement, test, deploy, and manage web sites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other technologies.
Developing something new requires you to be self-motivated on individual assignments, and work well with a team, communicating your progress and needs clearly and efficiently.  We are swimming in new water and therefore surprises come, assignments change quickly, and instructions are limited. Great developers will flourish in these situations and find joy in working through the mud.  
If this sounds good to you, then email us at jobs@pyrofex.net with the subject line, ""LET ME BUILD IT!!!!!"" We would like to see a resume or your linkedin profile. We would enjoy a cover letter in which you tell us about your work ethic and your favorite project. If you can send us examples of your code, that would be most excellent.
While our company does offer some remote positions, this is NOT a remote position, and we will only consider candidates who are from the Utah area.   ","Mid-Level, Senior, Lead","Computer Software, Cryptocurrency, Security Software",Full-time,/jobs/199446/web-developer-pyrofex-corporation,2019-01-06 22:51:33.363812,$,Frontend Developer,15,29,22.0,352

        ",-,,"
We believe that our approach towards Technical Product Management is truly unique. We objectively define each product in terms of the market it serves and the technology it leverages.We uncover market-gaps by identifying CIV (Challenging, Important or Valuable) problems specific to that domain. We employ a standardized process to elicit relevant information from SMEs and succinctly describe each CIV Problem.We then define Core Functionality (CFs) which the product will implement in order to address each CIV Problem. Through a combination of CIV Problems and CFs, we are in a position to analyze the product-market fit in an objective, standardized fashion. A CIV problem without any CFs is a remaining gap, while a CF which doesn’t address a CIV problem represents unnecessary complexity.Once we have articulated the product-market fit, we turn our attention (and most of our time) towards identifying the Important Technical Decisions (ITDs) that will provide this core functionality in the most effective way.Success as an SVP of TPM requires deep technical skills across a variety of technologies in addition to exemplary communication skillsSpecifically, candidates must haveA Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or a related discipline, (M.Sc. or Ph.D. preferred)5+ years of hands-on production code development and architecture experience in Java or C# on a scalable, commercial product5+ years experience in a senior architecture role at a leading software company, or as CTO/technical co-founder at a smaller company or successful startupExcellent communication skills in written and spoken English, and the ability to identify and articulate patterns in unstructured and unorganized content5+ years of experience being responsible of approving other people's technical design decisionsPrimary decision maker for how individual cloud services should be used correctly as a part of what you were buildingCrossover is redefining the way people work.

We believe that our approach towards Technical Product Management is truly unique. We objectively define each product in terms of the market it serves and the technology it leverages.We uncover market-gaps by identifying CIV (Challenging, Important or Valuable) problems specific to that domain. We employ a standardized process to elicit relevant information from SMEs and succinctly describe each CIV Problem.We then define Core Functionality (CFs) which the product will implement in order to address each CIV Problem. Through a combination of CIV Problems and CFs, we are in a position to analyze the product-market fit in an objective, standardized fashion. A CIV problem without any CFs is a remaining gap, while a CF which doesn’t address a CIV problem represents unnecessary complexity.Once we have articulated the product-market fit, we turn our attention (and most of our time) towards identifying the Important Technical Decisions (ITDs) that will provide this core functionality in the most effective way.Success as an SVP of TPM requires deep technical skills across a variety of technologies in addition to exemplary communication skillsSpecifically, candidates must haveA Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or a related discipline, (M.Sc. or Ph.D. preferred)5+ years of hands-on production code development and architecture experience in Java or C# on a scalable, commercial product5+ years experience in a senior architecture role at a leading software company, or as CTO/technical co-founder at a smaller company or successful startupExcellent communication skills in written and spoken English, and the ability to identify and articulate patterns in unstructured and unorganized content5+ years of experience being responsible of approving other people's technical design decisionsPrimary decision maker for how individual cloud services should be used correctly as a part of what you were buildingCrossover is redefining the way people work.

A CIV problem without any CFs is a remaining gap, while a CF which doesn’t address a CIV problem represents unnecessary complexity.Once we have articulated the product-market fit, we turn our attention (and most of our time) towards identifying the Important Technical Decisions (ITDs) that will provide this core functionality in the most effective way.Success as an EVP of TPM requires deep technical skills across a variety of technologies in addition to exemplary communication skills.Specifically, candidates must haveA Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or a related discipline, (M.Sc. or Ph.D. preferred)5+ years of hands-on production code development and architecture experience in Java or C# on a scalable, commercial product10+ years experience in a senior architecture role at a leading software company, or as CTO/technical co-founder at a smaller company or successful startupExcellent communication skills in written and spoken English, and the ability to identify and articulate patterns in unstructured and unorganized content10+ years of experience being responsible of approving other people's technical design decisionsPrimary decision maker for how individual cloud services should be used correctly as a part of what you were buildingCrossover is redefining the way people work.

We use only the best nutrient forms and publish our sources and research for all to see -- because transparency is kind of our thing. Our mission is simple: to inspire women to feel their best, every day, through healthy, daily habits.
Our team of curious skeptics is made up of world class scientists, artists, e-comm whizzes, and straight up hustlers. We’re small, well-funded, and on a mission to reinvent an entire industry.
Essential
You will be the one who designs and implements systems that connect all the pieces of the business. This includes short and mid-term projects that will immediately move key company metrics as well as laying the technical foundation for long-term success.
This is an exciting opportunity and critical role for a very fast-growing brand. We believe that great digital experiences are an important part of any company’s success, and we think you'll agree. As a subscription service, we help our customers better invest in the products they’ve subscribed to, by reinforcing the habits that help them in their long-term mission. You’ll be a part of a strong digital product team of designers, product managers, and data analysts to continuously add to and improve our customers’ experiences online at scale.
What you’ll do

Help lead the architecture and execution of everything back-end.
Establish engineering processes, define company engineering standards, identify and implement core technologies, and remove technical hurdles.
Work directly with our other Engineers, Designers, Product, and Marketing teams to implement core features across our customers’ experiences.
Build solutions for appropriate scalability. You're ok building something ""hacky"" if it fits the need, but can also call out real issues and create simple, scalable solutions for them.

What you’ll use

Our homepage (marketing pages) use React, Gatsby, GraphQL, and Contentful headless CMS.
Our checkout + account experiences use Ember, JSONAPI, and work directly with our Rails API.
Our back-end is a Rails API that handles everything from account creation, payments, all the way through to fulfillment.

Who you are

An application pioneer. You get jazzed about building experiences for people on the web, helping them get to the things they need, while delighting them wherever they may be. You've worked on creating back-end micro-services, API design/versioning, webhooks, load balancers, caching solutions, serverless tech, database stuff, Rails apps, and more. All over the board, huh? If you can handle anything that's thrown at you – we want you.
Humble Craftsman. You take pride in your work, and look for opportunities to iterate and make it better. You prioritize a simple solution over a complex one, leaning on the tools available to make your job easier, while ensuring solid test coverage backs up the decisions you’ve made.
Data driven. You believe that great data enables you and others to make better decisions.
Collaborator. You can dive deep and have complex technical conversations with your engineering team, nerd out over design decisions, and then turn around and explain those same conversations to non-technical teams.
Up for a challenge. You believe that just because something is difficult that it is not a reason for not doing it. In fact, that might be validation that it is worth doing, right?

What You Need

Education: BS in Computer Science or other engineering/technical field. Equivalent experience also accepted.
Experience: 3-5 years of developing clean, scalable and efficient web apps in a fast-paced environment.
Extensive experience with Ruby and the Rails framework.
A demonstrated ability to identify and solve real-world user problems.
An understanding of troubleshooting issues that may arise, and planning for scale.
Interest in learning additional skills/technologies as we continue to scale our platform and suite of tools.

We believe that great digital experiences are an important part of any company’s success, and we think you'll agree. As a subscription service, we help our customers better invest in the products they’ve subscribed to, by reinforcing the habits that help them in their long-term mission. You’ll be a part of a strong digital product team of designers, product managers, and data analysts to continuously add to and improve our customers’ experiences online at scale.
What You'll Do

Help lead the design, architecture, and execution of everything front-end web.
Establish engineering processes, define company engineering standards, identify and implement core technologies, and remove technical hurdles.
Work directly with our other Engineers, Designers, Product, and Marketing teams to implement core features across our customers’ experiences.
Build solutions for appropriate scalability. You're ok building something ""hacky"" if it fits the need, but can also call out real issues and create simple, scalable solutions for them.

What You'll Use

Our homepage (marketing pages) use React, Gatsby, GraphQL, and Contentful headless CMS.
Our checkout + account experiences use Ember, JSONAPI, and work directly with our Rails API.
Our back-end is a Rails API that handles everything from account creation, payments, all the way through to fulfillment.

Who You Are

Front-end focused. You get hyped about CSS animations, great transitions, and the overall possibility of the web. You pride yourself on code cleanliness and structure, and you know that your best code is ahead of you. You love new technologies that make your work life better, things like Sass, Handlebars, and modern Javascript libraries like React, Ember, and Gatsby. Sometimes, you may even like to grab an animation library and play with animating graphs or typography, you know, for fun.
Humble Craftsman. You take pride in your work, and look for opportunities to iterate and make it better. You prioritize a simple solution over a complex one, leaning on the tools available to make your job easier, while ensuring solid test coverage backs up the decisions you’ve made.
Data driven. You believe that great data enables you and others to make better decisions.
Collaborator. You can dive deep and have complex technical conversations with your engineering team, nerd out over design decisions, and then turn around and explain those same conversations to non-technical teams.
Up for a challenge. You believe that just because something is difficult that it is not a reason for not doing it. In fact, that might be validation that it is worth doing, right?

What You Need

Education: Open to all degrees! Equivalent experience also accepted.
Experience: 3-5 years of developing clean, scalable and efficient web apps in a fast-paced environment.
Strong experience in Javascript, and either React or Ember, with a passion for strong test coverage.
A demonstrated eye for design, as well as the ability to identify and solve real-world user problems.
An understanding of troubleshooting issues that may arise, and planning for scale.
Interest in learning additional skills/technologies as we continue to scale our platform and suite of tools.

ReactJS/Native and Serverless AWS Developers,"aws-lambda, reactjs, react-native, aws-cognito, aws-aurora",On-site and limited remote,Reino Unido,Maidenhead,"CoachHire.com
        ",50,Private,"
An amazing opportunity for full-stack Javascript developers to build a modern, serverless product from scratch, creating the team working-style and best practice as we go.
Job description
If it involves client and server-side Javascript, you can build it, and if it's some new technology you haven't used before... you'll figure it out.
Selecting and using modern development methods and following agile practices, you will build top-to-bottom functionality with ReactJS and React Native for the web & mobile front-ends, through to AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Step Functions, Kinesis, Aurora, Cognito, Pinpoint, Cloud Directory, Redshift, SQS, Quicksight… and as much of the rest of the AWS FaaS and platform services as make sense to allow you to focus on building applications rather than plumbing.
You will be part of a new, three-developer team, to deliver a modern application suite that enables companies, public sector organisations, schools and the general public to book and manage the transport they need to get their staff, students and holidaymakers to where they need to be…. think Uber™ for coaches!
Working in harmony with a devops lead, you’ll also need to lend a hand defining the Terraform based configurations, and figuring out the best methods and tech to introduce CI/CD efficiencies.
Based amongst some of your user base in our Cox Green, Maidenhead office, you will have ample opportunity for corridor testing of ideas through prototypes, whilst more formal UAT will be structured to ensure you (and we!) have the confidence your product will deliver in live.
Please note that this is not a home or remote worker role, so you must be commutable to Cox Green, however, as with all developer roles, we expect there will be a number days during each week where you simply need to stay home, get your head down and code!
About you
You’re a self-starter: a highly enthusiastic and motivated Javascript-centric developer used to adapting to and learning new technologies, design patterns and architectures as the need arises.
You love building product that people actually use and just as importantly you care passionately about quality: not just in the end product, but also in delivering code that other developers can maintain, using best-practice design principles and coding standards.
You wouldn’t dream about writing code without an accompanying test, and you treasure the DevOps principles of developers and technical operations working in harmony to embed security, scale and resilience into your continuous delivery strategy.
Teamwork means more to you than just sharing the tea-runs and buying the Haribo™  on your birthday. You actively assist and mentor your peers in their own learning, know when to ask for help yourself, and the two highlights of your sprint cycle are the planning and retrospective sessions, where you both give and take across story definition, personal recognition and constructive suggestions for improvements.
Your skills

Javascript Expert: you know your promises from your closures and can tell the difference between your observables, prototypes and modules.


ReactJS: if you haven’t yet, then you know you want to; and can instead demonstrate your expertise across Angular, Ember, Dojo or Vue.


React Native: you may have only dabbled, or you may have apps already on the stores, complete with shelling out to native components and SDKs like Geolocation or NFC. Alternatively, if you’ve got some Android Java, SWIFT or ObjectiveC under your belt, then it all counts.
AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Step Functions… or NodeJS: Let’s be realistic… not every developer has worked for forward-thinking companies that know serverless is the future, so if you haven’t yet had a chance to ditch the [virtual] tin, prove to us instead that you are a NodeJS guru and can learn the modern AWS FaaS methodologies as you go.
Redux? Webpack? Gulp? Browserify? Flux? Relay? Flow? ImmutableJS?: If you have the skills and can prove the advantage of your preferred libraries to your peers, then consensus will mean go for it (license agreement permitting).
HTML/CSS/SASS/LESS/REST/JSON: Duh!
TDD/BDD: we shouldn’t even have to mention it. You’ve been on Github. You know that no self respecting NPM ships without its tests. You practice what you preach and provide unto others what which you expect to consume yourself… and it’s not an afterthought.
Terraform: if you’ve got it, we’ll take it.
Security ingrained: You know your CAPTCHAs from your SQL injection from your brute force attacks, how to specify and develop to mitigate them, and under the covers you know your IAM from your KMS from your Secrets Manager and will layer security throughout your application stack. ...PII - encrypt it!
English Communication Skills: you can debate your technical solutions with developers and business people alike. You won’t be expected to write War & Peace, but you will be expected to keep the development wiki comprehensible

Our apps are used by tens of millions of people every month and downloaded hundreds of thousands of times per day. This enormous traffic, coupled with our insatiable curiosity to know more and drive to optimize our performance, makes so that we end up storing and constantly retrieving, visualizing, and analyzing large amounts of data. Hence, we’re looking for a passionate, bright, and driven data engineer that’s eager to bring our data-related technologies to the next level.
A few examples of your responsibilities:

Work closely with our Data Scientists, Data Analysts, and Performance Marketers to identify the data-related tooling and infrastructural needs of the company, and participate in defining the plan to fulfil them.
Help define the software architecture of new data tools or that of new features for existing tools, and then develop them. The work spans broadly from the most infrastructure- or backend-oriented to the implementation of data-science algorithms and the development of complex front-ends.
Constantly improve the quality of our tools and infrastructure by fixing bugs and refactoring the code base where necessary.
Expand our set of libraries as needed to make yourself as well as other engineers more efficient and effective.
Stay informed on new, relevant technologies and test the promising ones to make sure we don’t miss out on game-changing opportunities to boost our productivity and the enjoyment of our work.

What we offer

Huge impact. Your software will help us store, retrieve, visualize, analyze, and ultimately make sense of enormous amounts of data and ultimately make a real difference on how well we serve our tens of millions of users and whether we win or we lose in the market.
Talented, knowledgeable colleagues. You’ll get the chance to learn (and teach to!) some of the brightest and most skilled people you’ll ever meet. Your talent is going to blossom here.
Cool tech stack. We strive to use the best, most modern tools and technologies, and when they fall short of our expectations we invent our own. It’s a geek’s paradise.
Own products. We don’t work for clients, but only develop our own apps. Freed from politics, we can move fast and be daring.

        ",50,VC Funded,"
WHO ARE DRIFTROCK?
Driftrock was started with the aim of making advertising through social channels better. There’s no excuse for being chased around the internet by images of products you’ve already bought. It’s irritating for the end user and counterproductive for the company attempting to sell their products or services. Using our tooling marketers can refine their targeting such that the ads are only shown to people who have shown genuine interest.
WORKING AT DRIFTROCK
Driftrock’s tooling provides our users with a way to receive, transform, track and optimise leads from social channels. Currently these tools look and feel very separate so we’re in the process of bringing them together, with the view to having Driftrock be more of a platform than a set of tools. Other problems we’re solving, and are looking to solve in the near future, include:

How to securely and safely handle personally identifying information;
How to enrich incoming data with information that will help our users decide on the best next steps for their leads;
What reports to provide to our users such that they can see if their efforts are resulting in quality leads and what they can do to improve.

The technology is a mixture of Ruby, Elixir and React applications hosted on Kubernetes and Google Cloud. We make use of Redis and Postgres for data storage and RabbitMQ for event processing.
You will be expected to:

Build RESTful APIs, event-based systems and front-end applications;
Work with well-known public APIs like Facebook and LinkedIn;
Design and improve user experience;
Support production systems;
Manage cloud infrastructure.

ABOUT THE TEAM
We’re a small team of 15 people at Driftrock but we’re growing. Our product development team is 7 people with 6 developers and 1 CTO, this means that anyone we bring in can have a huge impact on the culture and practices of the team.
We believe in continuous improvement and we are constantly refining and improving how we work and communicate. One of the ways we do this is by performing fortnightly retrospectives, which are often run by different team members.
Currently we make use of daily standups and weekly prioritisation meetings to ensure we're pulling in the same direction and maintaining our focus of delivering value to our end users early and often.
REQUIREMENTS

You should be keen to learn and improve technical, product and personal skills;
You want to be involved in crafting products whilst building on the culture and process of the product team;
You are happy working in a small team, collaborating closely with other engineers as well as our product and sales teams;
You can provide new and diverse viewpoints for our technical and product discussions;
You are interested in agile practices such as continuous delivery, TDD, pair programming, code reviews and retrospectives;
You are keen to ensure there is a high standard of quality and security in the software we produce as a team;
You are interested in mentoring and coach other team members;
You have had some exposure to Ruby, Elixir or Javascript (we do not expect you to have experience in all of those languages);
You have the right to work in the UK.

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
The interview process has some flexibility but is primarily made up of the following stages:

An initial phone conversation with an engineer;
A take home technical test/coding challenge;
Followed by an on-site pairing interview, where we'll build on your code challenge solution. We then do an informal problem solving task and we finish up with an informal chat with the rest of the team;
For more information on what to expect from the interview process, check out this blog post.

We try our hardest to reduce the amount of stress involved in the process, we’re not trying to catch you out with trick questions and if at any point (even on the take home test) you have any questions for us we encourage you to ask them.
BENEFITS

You will work with passionate and smart people, in an environment where we firmly believe in sharing knowledge;
You will be an integral part of a growing and innovative tech startup;
You can be enrolled to the Company’s pension scheme;
The company atmosphere is social and friendly;
You will be part of fun monthly team events.

We will not be considering any recruitment agencies for this role.

Blinkist is a digital service with millions of users around the world, and our AWS-powered platform is the backbone of all our engineering efforts.

Extend and improve our container-based AWS infrastructure, managed with Terraform
Automate ruthlessly to ensure a resilient, self-tuning system setup (no 24/7 support necessary)

Develop systems and processes to enable Blinkist to seamlessly distribute its backend applications worldwide

At least two years hands-on experience in development/operations environments
Experience and interest in programming, ideally in Go, Python or Shell
Knowledge of AWS and container technologies like Docker and Kubernetes
Experience with CI/CD practices and systems like Jenkins, CircleCI, or TravisCI

A constant will to learn and grow, and to share knowledge with others
A passion for collaboration

Your Challenge

You will be part of this rotation in the team so everybody can be the Hero of the Day. How do we measure this? You will get Tacos (digital ones at least) and if you are competitive you can go up against the current leaders, but let me tell you, that’s going to be tough.

You know how to work with technologies/architectures:> Web services like SOAP, REST; CI/CD (Jenkins), automated testing (unit                            integration, load). > Docker, marathon, mesos, elasticsearch, kibana.

Nice to have is experience with:IT Security best practices,  JMeter/Gatling, API Management tools and concepts, AWS cloud services.

        ",50,VC Funded,"
The elevator pitch 👋
Take the lead on fully automating our DevOps and be part of our international and collaborative team of curious remote developers building consumer tech front-ends in React/React-Native and complex infrastructure backend in Node.js (microservices).
We’re looking for a DevOps developer that can craft and implement a fully automated CI/CD pipeline and institutional deployment at (massive) scale.
About you 👩‍🚀👨‍🚀
We’re excited to tell you about Aula and what we’re working on, but first of all, let us explain who we’re looking for. The most important thing about you is that you are curious and care deeply about building great products that affect people’s lives. You are excited about joining a startup with all the ups and downs that entails. You are transparent, reliable and considerate. You are excited about shipping quickly. You are excited about trying out the newest technologies. You are ready to work hard to further our mission.
Beyond this, our requirements are:

A passion for making developers’ lives easier and happier
Thorough knowledge of CI/CD Tooling
Programming experience in Node.js
Comfortable with infrastructure as code and deployment to public clouds
Extensive experience in designing Unix/Linux system architecture
Deep expertise in deploying cloud solutions (AWS etc)
Solid experience with containerisation technologies (Docker, Kubernetes)
Experience with Terraform and other Hashicorp products.
Experience with production databases management and deployments
You live within GMT-5 and GMT+5.5 (from South America/Central US time to India, Pakistan and some of Russia) for us to be awake at the same time.

About us 🔮
Aula is a communication platform for education. Think ‘Slack for education’: consumer tech on the front-end yet complex infrastructure on the back-end. We’ve built Aula because we believe digital learning infrastructure should encourage community and participation-based learning.
For students, this means less one-way communication from the teacher, more collaboration with fellow students (using integrations with tools like GitHub and codepen) and easier access to student services like the welfare team - even if you’re commuting or are away from campus on a placement. We’ve recently raised a $4.2m seed round and some people think we’re worth watching out for.
Our team 👋 🗺
We’re a bunch of people from all over the world (Denmark, Philippines, France, Albania, Georgia, Pakistan, Sweden, India, UK and US) that care deeply about making educational experiences more engaging. Our developers have previously lead teams that have built things like the Georgian version of Youtube (myvideo.ge with 2.5 million monthly unique viewers) and a novel way to share and view 3D medical images (TissueStack), so beyond focusing on creating a supportive and collaborative environment where features get shipped quickly, we also have quite a bit of experience.
You’ll be working closely with your team so we thought you should hear from two of your future team members, Oliver and Brice.
We are backed by a world-class team of investors such as Project A, Nordic Makers (an angel group including Co-founders of Unity and Zendesk) and executives from LinkedIn and IBM.
Our tech stack 💾🛠
We only use the bleeding edge tools to build educational infrastructure of the 21st century. We’ve explained it in more detail in this blog post, but here’s a quick overview of what we’re building with:

React (and React Native)
Microservices backends with Node.js and AWS
Docker
ES6/7 Javascript
Redux
Mongo, Redis and others dbs

For DevOps in particular, you’ll be working with tools like

Terraform (‘infrastructure as code’)
Multiple database types
General Javascript including Node.js
Docker
AWS
Our internal CLI

Working at Aula 🗽🎢
We think the most important variable in choosing a job is getting the chance to work on complex and important problems with friendly and curious people in a collaborative environment.
But beyond that, joining Aula also means

A rare opportunity to build a DevOps setup from the ground up
Being part of a fast-paced and mission-driven startup made up of a creative, friendly and international team.
Plenty of responsibility, autonomy and encouragement to shape your own tasks and contribute original ideas.
A supportive environment with an intense focus on learning and improvement

You’ll be doing pair programming, have one-on-ones where we speak about how to develop you both as a programmer and a leader, and occasionally jump on a video call and share a ‘remote meal’ while a team member speaks about a topic they care about. Once a month we also have ‘Mad Computer Science Idea’-day, where the entire team gets together to create something that has never been created before or using some tech that’s usually not used for that purpose.
The role 😼
We’re looking for a seasoned developer that can take the lead on creating a fully automated DevOps setup to make our developer team really happy.
Here’s a snapshot of what you’ll be working on:

Infrastructure deployment/management:

Management of our current infrastructure.
Monitoring of our resources: dozens of network interfaces, hundreds of servers, dozens of databases, etc.
Deployment of new infrastructure resources (new institutional environments)


Tooling

Integrate all the automation around infrastructure/deployments into the Aula-CLI
Create new tools to ease other developers’ lives/deployments


Deployment/test pipeline

Create/maintain the right pipeline in order to ensure maximal automation around running our tests and deployments
Full CI/CD pipeline



We already use a number of solutions for automating repetitive and/or critical tasks. All our infrastructure is managed via Terraform, and we’ve built a custom CLI that automates deployments, automates parts of the development and allow for easy troubleshooting and local development.
A big part of the role is to continue building on top of those existing tools and to bring new ones that would fit our environment and needs.
2 main rules:

Infrastructure as (reusable) code
Automate all the things!

Benefits 🍰

Personal development is part of being 'a high performer'. Each quarter, you'll set targets for your own personal development.
Shared ownership: Joining the Aula journey means you will own part of the company. 📈
Technology: Get hooked up with the technology you need to do your best work. 💻
Free books: Whatever you want to read.  🤓
Family leave: We offer enhanced family leave, no matter if you're the one giving birth or not - and a commitment to open, continuous communication. 🐣

We need to develop, test, and release software that scales, quickly and reliably. Over the last few years, we’ve built a highly skilled team of software engineers that is making a real impact to our business, and shaking up our industry.
We care about code quality, test automation and continuous delivery. Our developers drive our technology choices and own the software they create from their laptop all the way through to production. We’re building a better energy company, and we’re doing it one Git commit at a time.
Right, I’m convinced… but where in the world of OVO will I be working?
VCharge is the centrepiece of OVO’s ambition in becoming the world leader in distributed energy technology. It is an intelligent control layer running on top of the already existing energy infrastructure, giving both the market players as well the end consumers a fast forward ticket to the distributed energy future. VCharge will be the nervous system of the OVO’s energy IoT landscape sitting between grid operators and end customers, and connecting energy suppliers, energy IoT and VPP.
That sounds great! What will I be doing?

Own, architect, build and scale parts of our microservice platform.
Drive both product and technical improvements.
Communicate your ideas, engage with different teams and encourage debate and collaboration.
Mentor and develop the skills of your team members.
Share your innovative technical ideas with the wider team internally, and ideally building a public profile through our Tech Blog.


That sounds super exciting, but… Do I have what it takes?

Experience designing and building scalable, distributed applications.
Expert understanding of multiple languages such as Scala, Go, Python or Node.
Experience with asynchronous event driven programming using distributed commit logs.
A security conscious approach to development, especially in regards to IoT integrations.
Experience working in a full continuous delivery environment.
Experience driving automation across build, test and release processes.
An exceptional people person and communicator, able to share your ideas effectively.
A leader in your field of expertise, perhaps speaking at events or running meet-ups.
Recognised widely as a go to person on one or more technical areas.
A keen mentor of others, taking pride in helping other engineers improve their technical skills.
Experience leading communities of practises or teams.
You consistently exhibit our technology behaviours at a high level.

We’re builders.How we build.At Workstate, building doesn’t just apply to technology.We apply it to everything we do -- building relationships, skillsets, retirement accounts, technical knowledge, music collections, recipe files, dad joke collections, movie recommendations, travel logs, childhood toy recollections … and more. So much more. We build to last.But, the technology...No matter what we’re building, the technology forms the backbone of all our projects. We’re not purists, though.

Our Data Story
With thousands of active lots every day, hundreds of thousands of daily bids, millions of users, and countless marketing campaigns, the Catawiki platform generates vast amount of data every day.

With this in mind, Catawiki is building a new distributed data platform using tools from the Hadoop ecosystem that can accommodate the rapidly growing amount of data and requirements of analysts, data scientists, and product owners. 
We have started streaming event data and writing data pipelines in Apache Airflow that transform this data with Apache Spark, and now Catawiki needs more Data Engineers to help us tackle the challenge of bringing even more data sources into our platform and transforming and organizing this data for analysis and consumption by other applications. It’s a big challenge but one that we’re really excited about solving.

Explore new ways of transforming and analyzing data and continuously expand and improve the performance of our data pipelines.
Build prototypes, fast, and determine what their worth are in the business and within the infrastructure before iterating and improving them.
Work closely with Data Scientists and Product Managers to decide how best to structure and store data in order to make it easily accessible to business users.
Evaluate and develop highly distributed Big Data solutions; You will advance our software architecture and tool set to meet growing business requirements regarding performance and data-quality.

Who you are

A Data Engineer who likes to experiment with and explore new tools and technologies. You will be familiar with tools in the Hadoop ecosystem including Spark, Kafka, Hive or similar.
You are a Software Engineer with experience in modern backend web technologies.
You know how to design and build low-maintenance, high performing ETL processes and Data pipelines.

"Distributed Systems Engineer, for a decentralised legal agreements network.","go, kubernetes, ethereum, consensus, cryptography",Paid relocation,Reino Unido,London,"Monax
        ",50,VC Funded,"
Distributed Systems Engineer - to help us build a public, decentralised, blockchain-backed legal agreements network
London£40,000 - £80,000 plus options (ESOP).
Relocation package available for the right candidate. This role could also be based in our Edinburgh office.
Candidates currently based outside of London or Edinburgh must indicate their preferred location and willingness to relocate in their cover letter. 
We are looking for kind, talented software engineers to help us make smart iterations on our legal agreements network as we deploy successive test networks.
Monax were pioneers of permissioned blockchains and smart contracts and we are building our Agreements Network to allow new and more efficient forms of legal transacting. Exploiting the benefits of various decentralised, distributed, and masterless technologies - chiefly Hyperledger Burrow, which Monax built from scratch and still maintains based on the Tendermint consensus engine.
You will have the chance to work on a system that has distributed consensus and validation in a low trust environment at its heart and offers very interesting challenges, these could be:

Working with multiple clusters of nodes, most of which are not under your control to handle semi-automated network upgrades and governance votes. How do you upgrade a network you do not control?
Using cryptographic primitives like Verifiable Random Functions to orchestrate churn amongst network validators
Build package manager and compiler integrations for deploying and testing smart contracts
Implement low-level virtual machine instructions and improvements to our Ethereum Virtual Machine implementation

Working with our CTO on our Node Distribution Team you can expect to quickly own significant parts of our stack, and make decisions that will affect the company’s future viability in a fast-moving space (public permissioned consensus networks). You would also work closely with our Product Team who are responsible for building the foundational smart contracts, the business process modelling engine that drives the Agreements Network and also our particular front end (the network is open to extension by any of our co-founders however).Your role will give you the chance to work across all teams in the business and it will also give you the opportunity to leave your mark in a growing industry, where you need to evaluate existing best practices and apply them to new technological paradigms and new programming languages. Navigating between the hype, the detractors and the zealots we believe there is real value in our approach and we intend to prove it.
You will join a business building a genuinely novel system, that in part intends to create an entirely new market by enabling legal products that challenge existing legal services.
This role would suit a talented software engineer, with solid technical skills in and a minimum of 3-4 years of software development experience. We are also open to engineers who can bring significantly more experience to the role. If you are a good match for Monax, we are willing to create a role that suits you.
Who do we need? Someone who has:

Go experience or the ability to pick it up in a few weeks
Kubernetes experience or the ability to pick it up in a few weeks
A degree-level qualification in a numerate discipline or equivalent evidence of analytic and reasoning skills and theoretical thinking
A good knowledge of algorithms and data structures
A hacker mentality towards making things work
An ability for long form design work ‘on pencil and paper’
An ineffable marmot-ness

It is crucial that you are able to take part in forceful yet respectful technical discussions with colleagues and that you are able to change your mind about something if required, and also are able to change other’s minds.Real things you might work on:

Build a Kubernetes operator for Hyperledger Burrow
Devise a way to compress/normalise data in our merkle tree to control our long-term storage usage
Implement an atomic swap with public Ethereum to represent value on our chain
Write optimised native (Go) functions, callable from evm, to implement graph traversal over our business processes
Build fee allocation and distribution models that help maintain our network and provide the correct incentives

What can Monax offer you?Extremely marketable blockchain and cryptocurrency skills.The chance to make blockchain systems live up to their hype by making them highly operable, our network will be operated peer-to-peer by many parties and this needs to be as painless as possible.Experience in blending distributed, decentralised, and centralised systems. To spend time working on something foundational at the level of a network architecture. The chance to spend time thinking ‘around the software’; about law, economics, and game theory.You will have a high level of autonomy.  The business has just enough hierarchy, consensus and individual project responsibility (c.f. design-by-committee) favoured over diktats.Flexible working - the successful candidate will be based in our London or Edinburgh work space primarily, but there is scope for flexible working and choosing your own hours and place of work when established.  Relocation assistance is available for the right candidate. Who will you be working with?Around fifteen people in our passionate cross functional team, including time with:

Our CTO in London, who would be your primary daily contact
Our CPO in New York, with whom you’ll liaise with to ensure the distribution platform and product stack work harmoniously.
Product Team members currently building the application stack.
Our Legal Engineers in New York providing crucial context to how legal products on the platform will be used
Our CEO in Edinburgh for just about anything else...

TrainerRoad is looking to expand our engineering group. We're looking for smart software engineers who ""get things done."" We’re interested in remote candidates in the USA or candidates interested in working in our Reno office.
Areas of work include React, TypeScript, Electron and React Native.
We're looking to hire 3x Javascript Developers to join our team.
App DevelopmentWe're moving our apps from cross-platform Xamarin to Electron/React Native. You'd be involved in this process and would work with an experienced engineer(s) to rebuild a section of the app.
Our goal is to increase the speed of app development. We do this through HRM, fast computers, a great build chain, automated testing, clear and well-defined issues and a dedicated QA team that tests every PR.
We track what our users do, learn from that and improve the product. We want this loop to be a quick as possible.
Our website is built in Angular 2+. With our move to React on the app side we'll be making new elements in React on the web.
This job is primarily for Electron (using React) and React Native app development, but there's room for someone to move to the web in the future or split their time between web/app.
Engineering Principles we believe in- Write good code, but not necessarily great code.Good code ships, great code gets ""tinkered"" with and debated about ad nauseam.
- Good code is understandable. We admit it, we've made things too complex in the past. We've had complex class hierarchies and really shown off our CS skills.
Sure, there's fewer lines of code, but it takes someone a few days to figure out what's going on and it's easy to write bugs.
We believe in a few more lines of code for the sake of clarity and debugging ease.
- Good code is testable, and we're pragmatic about testing. You don't get the same testing ROI for every line of code. We believe to test the areas that are most likely to break, are tricky or are likely to be changed. We still run thousands of unit tests per build, but we're not testing 1+1 = 2.
- Quick builds will set you free! To be a successful engineer, you need to get into ""flow"" (more on that below) as often as you can. That's why we love HRM.
- We want just enough process to be awesome, and nothing more.We have engineers review issues before a sprint for clarity and completeness. When they submit a PR there's always code review, UI/Unit tests run, then QA manually tests.
For the web, we automatically push every PR that's merged into Master.
For the app, we do weekly releases where there's a final regression test with all merged PRs from the previous week.
Our process prevents bugs/regressions and ultimately saves a lot of time.
- Long-running branches are the devilOften times projects will take weeks/months before they are launched.
Instead of experiencing a merge/testing hell at the end of the project we encourage small PRs into master with a ""feature flag"" on the new project that allows employees to use the feature in production but not our users.
Cool Things we Do- Every PR has a set of unit tests and automated UI tests run against it.- Every PR is code reviewed.- We have a dedicated QA team to manually check your PR (it requires four testers to sign off).- Every web PR that is approved is automatically deployed (CI).- We've got a beta system that has a flow of production data that helps you develop and test your code without worry of breaking things.- Everything is hosted on Azure. There's plenty of dev/beta/test servers and databases to use.- The web and app team have their own Product Managers.- We run two-week sprints. The web/app team reviews, estimates, and discusses all sprint issues before they are free to be worked.- We often pair program.- The majority of our engineers are remote.- We have a skilled design team that handles the HTML/LESS for app and website.
Who We're Looking ForWe want smart engineers who get shit done! Not only do you have to be smart, but you also have to be pragmatic.
Let's say you need to paint a room white.
Smart and Pragmatic Engineer: A pragmatic engineer fills up a sprayer (rather than use a paintbrush), gets to work, and makes sure they don't paint themselves into a corner.
Smart Engineer (but not pragmatic): A smart engineer who's not pragmatic might design a system to change the color of the room in just 30 seconds. Sure, it would take 2 months to build the system but we could change colors so quickly! It's totally optimized for repainting!
If the second example sounds like you, please do not apply. We know it's fun to go hog wild in projects but we need to ""get shit done"". There's a whole line of other engineers and designers waiting for that room to get painted so they can do their own work on it.
We're a Team, not a FamilyIt sounds harsh to say, but we're not a Family. I know lots of businesses call themselves a family, but I think it's BS. If you get drunk at work and yell at someone, we're going to let you go (although we would give Grandma a pass at Thanksgiving).
It's better to think of TrainerRoad like a sports team. Everyone has their role and their jobs. It's our jobs as managers to bring new hires up to speed, train them in our system, and coach them to be successful.
If someone is not performing, we need to talk to them, coach them, find out what's going wrong and where we can improve. If someone just can't perform to the standard level of the team and we can't coach them to get better, we have to let that person go.
Another clear sign that you have a high-performance team is that if everyone would ""enthusiastically rehire"" each other for their current roles. It really makes work wonderful when you respect, trust and value your co-workers.

Your Resume should have:- Links to any open source projects you've contributed to (not required)- Github/StackOverflow username if you'd like- Examples of experience in the ""Optional Technology Experience"" area
Your Cover Letter should have:- Let us know why you want to work for TrainerRoad
We also RequireThe best engineers only want to work with other great engineers. We've found that the best way to find great engineers is to have them code, not just answer trivia questions during an interview.
That's why we require applications to do a refactoring exercise as part of their job submission. The right candidate won't find this a pain in the ass; it should be enjoyable.
This also weeds out the vast majority of candidates who just fire off resumes everywhere.
You can find the refactoring exercise here: https://github.com/trainerroad/RefactoringChallenge
It has a README.md with instructions.
Excited about our Company?In your application let us know why you want to work with us and why you think you'd be a good fit for our company.
FAQs
Do I have to be a cyclist to apply?Nope! Not everyone in the company is a cyclist. It helps if you're an active racer but it's not required. If you are a racer or TrainerRoad user, let us know!
What's unlimited vacation mean?The CEO of TrainerRoad used to be an engineer at a Fortune 500 company where life was a grind. We believe employees put out their best work when they are happy and not burnt out.
If your brain just isn't working at 3 pm, we encourage employees to go home and rest up. It does no one any good to sit and stare at the computer screen for another two hours. We don't track that time.
Employees generally shoot for around four weeks of REAL vacation time (no slack checking) but some take more, and some take less. The thing we care about is how productive you can be and how much value you can add to the company. Bottom line, we want people who are passionate and get things done. If you meet those requirements, everything else works itself out.
That being said, if you end up taking massive amounts of vacation, come in late, leave early and aren't producing outstanding work we're going to have a problem.
How do you work?We're big believers in Deep Work and Flow. If you're not turning off Slack (snooze), going DND on your phone and shutting off the world for multiple hours a day you're probably not being as productive as you could be. The idea is a developer should be able to work on a chunk of work that they understand distraction-free for multiple hours totally. This is the only way the company moves forward.
We try to work as pragmatically as we can. We have excellent designers on staff who go from mockups to responsive HTML with light javascript work.
Development uses Github with a strict pull request process. We test, comment, refactor and improve each other's pull requests.
We have a QA team (we call them the Test Team) that checks every PR and does full regression checks for each App release, and we're continually getting more automated.
We have an Automation Team that only focuses on writing UI tests to speed up testing and find bugs faster.
We can one-click deploy our app on Alpha, Beta, and Production channels.
We can one-click deploy our website to Azure (includes smoke tests and warm up).
We have nightly builds that deploy to Test Flight and Google Play.
We often pair program via Slack.
We work off bi-weekly sprint issue lists on Github.
Developers get the super fast machines and awesome equipment. If it's going to let you be more productive, we want to spend the money on it.
You didn't ask about education, what's required?Please put your education on your resume, but we're not going to reject someone because they don't have a degree in Computer Science. We understand that some of the best and most passionate engineers are self-taught.
How long until I hear a response from you guys? What's the process?If you don't follow directions in this job posting, you'll be immediately rejected.
If you did follow directions, our goal is to review your refactoring within a week of submitting your application. All refactoring reviews are done ""blind""; meaning the reviewer doesn't know your name, resume or where you're from. Code is code, and it should be reviewed that way without bias.
If we like your refactoring, we'll have you do a coding logic quiz. Nothing super in-depth CS wise. We've found that the candidates who do the best on these exercises are very successful at TrainerRoad.
We'll take the top combined refactoring and coding quiz results and set you up for a team interview.
If the team likes you; we'll then set up a pair programming session with you and an engineer. We'll give you a tour of our codebase and work on a real issue. This gives you a chance to run away from our codebase screaming and also demonstrate that you can communicate with us.
If all of the above is good, you're hired!
I know this sounds like a lot of hoops to jump through, but it works so so well! Once you're onboard, you'll love that everyone else went through the same process and is up to ""your level"" in terms of ""get-shit-doneness"".
What's with the dishes analogy?Doing your own dishes is a GREAT analogy for our culture. Don't leave shit around for someone else to clean up. Do your own dishes. Do you see someone making a mess? Let's discuss it (in a productive manner) so that we can nip that behavior in the bud.
We know we're really doing well when someone points out a manager not ""doing their dishes"" or causing an extra headache for a process that doesn't add value (it happens). Seriously, we need employees to call managers out on this. I'm the CEO writing this; please oh please tell me if I'm messing up or not walking the talk.

Smart & High Energy Engineer - We work at a very fast pace on cutting edge hard problems and we need people who can keep up.   We need people who really love producing results for customers and who enjoy programming and exhibit the energy and creativity that comes from being fully engaged in the technical side of what we do.
Strong Software Development background - This job is definitely NOT for non technical project managers. Recent, hands-on experience coding both server side (C#) and client side (JavaScript) are strongly suggested, and 5+ years work experience as a professional programmer is required.  
Experience Wireframing UI & Designing APIs - You do not have to have strong artistic skills, but you should be comfortable not only spec-ing out UI wireframes but also designing the supporting technical web service API’s and/or client side component API’s.
Technical Project Management:  You should be highly organized with a strong history in either technical project management or as the lead developer for complex software development projects.  
Customer Facing: comfortable meeting with sophisticated customers and managing expectations on large high value multi million dollar projects.
GIS Background: a strong history of prior GIS projects is required.
Not Just a Manager: this job is for people who like getting their hands dirty and doing real work with their team.  Not every task can be delegated and we need high quality servant leaders who lead by example producing high quality work product on their own in addition to managing their team.

We currently have a frontend/backend split for development, where there’s a HTTP|REST API used for handoff between the two. As a backend developer, you generally produce REST APIs for consumption by the frontend team and provide 2nd line support. Most of the codebase is in PHP.
New projects tend to be created as Kubernetes microservices using PHP 7.x (or occasionally Java) and are automatically deployed through a Git push trigger via the CI tool. Legacy code tends to be more monolithic and have less test coverage. Your workload will consist of a mixture of new development and old code bases.
Projects range in size from less than a day to a few weeks in duration. You have flexibility to investigate and suggest new technologies for solutions to problems.
A “Typical Day” 
You’re working Flexitime, so today expect to work roughly 9:30 to 3pm and then 7pm to 9pm this evening. 
Today you’re working on a Kafka consumer which effectively takes data from a MySQL table and insert it into an ElasticSearch 5.6 cluster. You’ll need to write an ElasticSearch mapping schema, and unit / integration tests (using PHPUnit) for the code. 
Mid morning, you see a support issue on Slack (as you’re on ‘support’ this week) where some customers are having trouble posting to a certain social network. After some investigation and checking various logs, you identify a possible solution, discuss it with the team and implement a change to the publishing code. Initially, your change is feature flagged to restrict it to an internal account and you deploy it for support to to verify it before wider roll out.
Every few days there’s a development conference call where progress and priorities are discussed.

Backend Developer,"java, spring",,Reino Unido,London,"TransferWise
        ",5000,VC Funded,"
TransferWise was founded in 2011 with a clear mission: Money without borders - so people and businesses can send and receive any currency effortlessly, whenever, wherever.
Sure, the heart of what we do is international money transfer. And we’re committed to making it instant, convenient and fair for millions of people, all over the world. But we’re growing our other products and our teams at an exciting pace. And we’re looking for the very best to jump on board.
What it’s really like to work here
At TransferWise, we do things a bit differently. There’s no corporate nonsense and no old-fashioned hierarchy. Instead, we work in dozens of self-sufficient, autonomous teams. Think of them like start-ups within a start-up that learn from each other.
Each team picks the problems they want to solve. So there’s no micro-management. No hiding behind fancy job titles. And no one telling you what to do. You are your own boss. But you’ll get tons of guidance and plenty of support from talented, super-smart colleagues from all over TransferWise.
We’re going to be upfront - the way we work doesn’t suit everyone. But if freedom, autonomy, and life-affirming, head-scratching professional challenges rock your world, we could be a match made in heaven.
 So, what’s the role?
In general, as a Back End Engineer in TransferWise you will work towards making our product the best that it can be. On one hand you will do this by solving very complex technical puzzles while on the other hand, you will do this by figuring out what are the best product decisions based on feedback we get from our great customers. 
More specificly, we are currently growing our local Business engineering team which holds from an engineering perspective our TransferWise for Businesses product. So, currently looking for talented Back End Engineers ready and up to the challenge of helping us in scaling-up our Business product. What we re looking for:

Background with backend MVC framework - Java and SpringBoot preferred 
Experience with SQL databases, writing custom queries and designing schemas
Understanding of test driven development (TDD), and the desire to write tests
Experience in distributed and concurrent systems, knowing the tradeoffs between stateful/stateless and synchronous/asynchronous architectures.

However, we will give you 25 days holiday a year (plus public holidays), a fun, friendly atmosphere, plenty of opportunities to grow and the chance to be part of our little revolution. Oh, and coffee, there’s plenty of coffee.
Some important stuff we would like you to know
To meet our regulatory obligations as a licensed financial services company, TransferWise needs to take background checks on all new hires, which may include Criminal and Credit checks. Please discuss with the Recruiter if you have any concerns regarding this process.
At TransferWise we believe in fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace. Therefore, we want to make sure that our recruitment process is accessible to everyone. So if you need any reasonable adjustments – at any point in the process – we’ll do our best to help. Just let us know what you need on your application form, or drop us an email at adjustments@transferwise.com. You might need a reasonable adjustment if you’ve got a disability. Or maybe you live overseas, and you’d prefer to meet us over Skype.
Please don’t send anything to the adjustments address if you’re a recruiter, or if you’re making a speculative application. We do work with recruiters from time to time – but only through LinkedIn. And we only accept job applications when a position is actually open. So you’re better off just checking the recruitment pages regularly.
